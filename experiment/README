=head1 SYNOPSIS

Experimentation area.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This entire directory is designed to be an area where ideas can be toyed with
without the fear of changing existing work. This will consist mostly of proof of
concepts that only aim to demonstrate an idea, not provide functionality or
working code.

In other words, nothing in this directory should be taken serious.
