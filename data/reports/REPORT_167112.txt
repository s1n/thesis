I flew a normal Instrument Landing System approach to a normal landing; using normal reverse thrust. at 80 Knots; about halfway down the runway tower asked us to turn at the high speed turnoff. the Captain took the aircraft at 80 Knots and applied brakes but could not slow enough to make turnoff. I told tower we could not make high speed turnoff; but we would make next one. an MLG x landed and said; 'LGT Y is still on the runway.' we had blown a tire which accounts for our reduced braking. taxied to gate normally.
