AIRSPEED started to bleed off. disconnected Auto-Pilot. received stabilizer 1 and 2 warning (stabilizer trim 1 and 2) Multi Functional Display Unit message. controled trim with trim wheel. returned to Mountain Daylight Time airport and landed OVERWT. 91600 pounds. DIDN't declare emergency; however equipment was rolled. callback conversation with RPTR revealed the following information: the RPTR stated when the aircraft was on the ground; maintenance replaced numerous components but I DIDN't think anything mechanical failed. the RPTR stated the aircraft Auto-Pilot was in altitude capture mode with flaps extended. the company had the flight test crew fly the aircraft all day and could not duplicate the report. the RPTR said the First Officer and myself with a flight instructor flew the simulator for three hours and could duplicate the event only one time.
