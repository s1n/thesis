MAINT had disabled one of the ignition system to conduct a check. when the check was completed; one of the maintenance collars around the circuit breaker of an IGNITER was inadvertently left on; disabling that IGNITER. the airplane x was turned over to us in this condition. I failed to notice the disabled IGNITER; and the UNAIRWORTHY condition of my flight(S); during my PREFLT of the flight deck. the First Officer; still in his first YR at air carrier; did notice the disabled circuit breaker; but believed it to be part of a routinely disabled system. he did not recognize the UNAIRWORTHY condition. I pushed back with an UNAIRWORTHY aircraft because one half of at least one ignition system was inoperative as a result of the related circuit breaker being intentionally disabled by maintenance and then not returned to the functioning position after the check was over. the engine(S) started normally. I flew this aircraft for 2 legs with it in this condition. the Captain; who accepted the aircraft from me once we returned to seattle; noticed what I had failed to detect.
