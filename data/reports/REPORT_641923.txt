PLT complained that taxiway lights were too bright; causing difficulty in seeing. requested that we turn down lights. I informed pilot that lights were on lowest setting. we have had numerous complaints from many pilots about the taxiway lights being too bright. several pilots have said the lights are ruining their night vision and could be a possible hazard. could cause a runway incursion. the lights are painful to their eyes.
