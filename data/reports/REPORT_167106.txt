DUE to snow cover on assigned runway 17L; I inadvertently landed on the clean runway; 17R. on final I noticed snow removal equipment crossing the runway; but was told by tower to expect that; so it set off no alarm in my mind and it was Federal Aviation Regulation enough away that it presented no hazard in my judgement. after landing; I realized I as on the wrong runway and immediately advised the tower (they never even noticed my whereabouts until I called them); however; it was my mistake. I feel I was focusing too much attention on the student I was instructing and not enough on the big picture.
