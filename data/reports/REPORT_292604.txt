WHILE on a flight from CGE to RUQ the chief pilot took control of the aircraft on an instrument approach to RUQ. standard instrument procedures were not observed a teardrop type entry was made to intercept the final approach course. the weather was at minimums. a tight circling turn was attempted to land on the n end of the runway. the aircraft was not in a position to land on the runway. the airplane went off the side of the runway because the go around was initiated too late. there was still sufficient AIRSPD to fly the aircraft and it became airborne again. the aircraft was climbed out and I regained control. I entered a left downwind for the S runway and landed the aircraft safely. an inspection was made to the aircraft and there was no damage found. there was also no damage to the airport property. I believe the situation occurred because the old way of thinking was used; in that the Captain is always right. I also believe in order to prevent a recurrence is to properly train all FLCS in cockpit resource management.
