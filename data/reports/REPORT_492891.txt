I was cleared to taxi to runway 33. due to construction activities on the normal taxiway; I was cleared to taxiway g to runway 7 to runway 33. I believed I was cleared all the way to the E side across runway 33 and then double back on taxiway J for a standard full length departure. the controller informed me after I crossed runway 33 that he had not cleared me across runway 33. I believe the confusion over the taxiway closure and inattentiveness of the control tower Light Emitting Diode to this confusion. in the future; the controller could assist by stating; 'hold short; runway 33.'
