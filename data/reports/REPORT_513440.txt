WAS flying a C402/I inbound on the Instrument Landing System outside of the Final Approach Fix. radar service had been terminated approximately 5 minutes before and I was monitoring and advising on UNICOM (UNCTLED field). at 7.5 Distance Measuring Equipment a citation RPTED he was outbound on the reciprocal course for a procedure turn in a descent to my altitude of 1700 feet Mean Sea Level. I advised my position again and he continued. I then landed and as I taxied clear he RPTED on Common Traffic Advisory Frequency that he was missed approach. it seems clear to me that he violated either his clearance limit or center cleared 2 airplanes in the same non radar airspace. it was only after the citation went missed that I RPTED through the Flight Service Station that I was on the ground.
