ON jan/thu/04; I was working approach control in the atlanta Terminal Radar Approach Control Facility. I was on the n final radar position. I was told there was an aircraft diverting to atlanta with a medical emergency (apparently someone had a heart attack and had no pulse). while expediting the emergency aircraft to runway 26L I was using visual separation by the pilot from an aircraft on runway 27L and an aircraft on runway 26R. I'Mach Number not completely sure if the emergency aircraft read back visual separation on the B767 on runway 26R. the emergency aircraft landed safely on runway 26L approximately 3 mile behind the B767 on runway 26R.
