ENRTE from dallas/feet worth; TX (DFW) to MONTEGO bay; jamaica (MKJS) on the SBOUND leg from GLS Nondirectional Radio Beacon on A766; our aircraft Automatic Direction Finder'S were receiving erratic signals from GLS Nondirectional Radio Beacon and showing slightly W of course (139 degree bearing from the station). zhu called on the radio and RPTED that we were 11.8 mile E of A766 over BAROW intersection. immediately we made a course correction to the W. when in range of COZUMEL (CZM) Nondirectional Radio Beacon; we found that the #2 Automatic Direction Finder was operating normally; but the #1 Automatic Direction Finder was erratic and unreliable. the #1 Automatic Direction Finder was promptly entered into the maintenance log as inoperative and placarded by the Minimum Equipment List. we believe the GLS Nondirectional Radio Beacon was unreliable and caused the deviation.
