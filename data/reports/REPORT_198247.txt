THERE has been started a NDW procedure to deice/anti-ice MLG series aircraft by local policy at xxx airlines. this is in reference to the problem MLG aircraft have with ice forming on the upper wings and breaking off on takeoff and being ingested into the ENGS. the local policy is to use unheated mixture of GYCOL in a 2.5 gallon garden sprayer to apply to the wing surfaces. this procedure does not have the heat to remove and melt ice formed on the wing surface so does not remove ice from the wing surface if present. this policy was started to save GYCOL that is 'wasted' on aircraft. I have not been personally involved with this and have not used this procedure but see the problem that this does present for future operations. callback conversation with RPTR revealed the following information. mechanic RPTR indicates this policy is strictly a local policy at his maintenance station made by local management. it is his declaration that the cold GLYCOL cannot do the job sprayed from a garden hose. RPTR feels company had gone too Federal Aviation Regulation in attempting to save money and not waste GYCOL.
