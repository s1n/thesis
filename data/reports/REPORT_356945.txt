EXTREMELY busy after a runway change. had a broad mix of different type aircraft in downwind and forced to use many different altitudes to keep from overtaking slower with faster. I was stepping the jets down over the propellers. our procedures require my position to be at 9000 feet before turning OPS Base Operations Office leg. other final turns at 10000 feet. I thought I had taken the HS25 to 9000 feet; but he was still at 10000 feet when I turned him towards the final. once I noticed this; I descended the HS25 to 8000 feet and asked him to hurry. the C208 was on final at 10000 feet. I managed to get the HS25 about 700 feet below the C208 at turn-on. the HS25 went slightly through the Instrument Landing System and I corrected him back. once he was established; separation was achieved.
