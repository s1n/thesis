AFTER takeoff from sarasota I was to climb to 1600' Mean Sea Level. instead I climbed to 600' and told approach I was at 1600'. my transponder even said 600' but I insisted I was at 1600'. they told me to turn altitude RPTING off and then I received a clearance to climb to 4000'. as I went through 1000' I realized my error. I should have noticed the wrong reading of the altimeter but DIDN't as all of my flying is around 1000' Mean Sea Level takeoffs. also I should have noticed how low I was to the ground.
