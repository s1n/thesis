THE controller asked us to intercept a radial to the fellows VFR Omni-Directional Radio Range. both pilots attempted to reprogram the flight management system; but failed. neither pilot realized that we had passed the assigned intercept point until the controller assigned a new heading to REINTERCEPT the radial. moral of the story: one pilot should always be following the aircraft'S progress using 'raw data;' so that an Flight Management System malfunction can be discovered quickly.
