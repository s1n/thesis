I was Captain on flight PKB to pit. while dispatching flight several mistakes became known to me re: the weight and balance manifest before dispatching the flight. I discussed these with the Fahrenheit/O and the miscalculated weight and balance manifests were discarded. the filed weight and balance manifest reflected 1600# as takeoff fuel weight; but in fact was ramp fuel weight; the takeoff fuel weight being 1500 pounds which should have gone on the weight and balance form in the takeoff fuel weight section.
