SITUATION began on a routine Visual Flight Rules pleasure flight into luk airport. onboard aircraft were myself; an Air Traffic Control specialist station with a commercial certificate and instrument rating and the copilot AEFII/mei. at 10 mile NE of the airport we made the initial call up with the tower. we were instructed to fly straight in to runway 20L and report a 3 mile final. at 6 mile out the local controller was working about 5-6 aircraft on 2 parallel runways. at this time the controller asked an aircraft with a call sign close to ours to identify on the transponder. I heard the controller immediately start talking to another aircraft so I assumed that the instructions were for that aircraft. again the controller asked the aircraft with close call sign to do something; and I asked if the instruction was for me. again the controller started to talk to another aircraft. then the controller asked us; using wrong tail number; to switch to runway 20R. at that time I again asked if these instructions were for us. this time he understood me and realized he was using the wrong call sign and asked me to switch to runway 20R. over the numbers for 20R I had to ask for landing clearance which was received. even though no midair or violation took place; this situation could have developed into an incident. the controller did not wait for a reply or acknowledgement to his instructions and did not hear what was being said; but heard what he expected to hear! all pilots and controllers must be made aware to listen for a correct reply and an action taken by the one receiving the instruction. if the situation continues to develop; take action and determine the problem. in this case all the controller had to do is ask; 'aircraft instructed to report 3 mile final 20L say numbers.' with this information he could have easily have controled the situation by making certain of the aircraft he needed to communicate with was us.
