WHILE flying the RICHY 5 departure at S lake tahoe we climbed above an altitude specified in the Standard Instrument Departure. prior to takeoff at TVL the copilot (left seat) flying asked me to request a Visual Flight Rules climb from ZOA as soon as I was able to. TVL tower had issued the Standard Instrument Departure and 15000 feet; and call center at 10000 feet. I called at 10000; 10500; 11000 making contact at 11500. ZOA asked me to identify. ZOA asked for my altitude. by that time we were at 13000 feet. I was advised that in the future I should not climb above 12000 feet. I advised center I was planning on asking for a Visual Flight Rules climb as soon as I made contact with them.
