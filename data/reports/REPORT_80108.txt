WE were cleared to cross CUTTA at 10000' with all power off (at idle) and speed brakes pulled; we were not able to cross CUTTA. I told CLE center that we would not be able to get to 10000' in time to cross CUTTA as per clearance. they advised us to do the 'best we could'. this was (is) not a proper clearance given to us by Air Traffic Control. we made it to 10000 36 mile out instead of 29 mile. no conflicts of traffic. nothing said from CLE Air Traffic Control. my only comment is Air Traffic Control did not give a proper clearance; nor did they tell us to do anything else when I told them we could not make it.
