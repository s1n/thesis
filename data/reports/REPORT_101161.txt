THE seymour johnson echo military mperating mrea (in NC) is activated on an as needed basis. in the past; GSB tower contacted the controller at SAMLO sector for the airspace; who in turn would coordination with the affected sectors. GSB tower complained several months ago that on occasion it takes several minutes to activate. the result is the approach supervisor contacts the Fahrenheit area supervisor for the military mperating mrea who is to do the coordinating with the affected sectors. the problem has been continually with the supervisor giving away the airspace without the controllers approval or in several cases without his knowledge. in one case there was an aircraft in the altitudes given away. I am now keeping a list of specific times and events concerning this matter.
