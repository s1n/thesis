ON jun/XA/01; flight departed ZZZ for ATL. on the CLBOUT we got a passenger door handle out caution light. I called for the Quick Reference Handbook checklist. the Quick Reference Handbook checklist did not correct the problem. we notified Air Traffic Control; air carrier; the flight attendant; the passenger; and returned to ZZZ.
