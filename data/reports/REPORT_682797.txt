I was working the BOSOX sector radar position at ZBW. there was no radar associate assigned. air carrier x; an MD80; was landing at PSM. air carrier Y; an A320; departing boston. I intended to stop air carrier Y at 16000 feet; but went to work separating 2 aircraft landing on longitude island. the second aircraft in this string had increased speed and was rapidly catching up to the aircraft ahead. also at this time a BDL departure was in conflict. after fixing this situation; I noticed air carrier Y climbing through 16700 feet; and expedited his climb. I had inadvertently issued FL230; which is the altitude most aircraft from boston are climbed to. the closest the 2 aircraft got were 4.2 mile and 2400 feet.
