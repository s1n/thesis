LOCATED at the approximately coordinates listed above are 5 towers supporting various microwave radio-relay antenna. two towers are located E of U.S. highway 85 (site 1) and 3 towers are located W of the highway (site 2). one of the towers supports Ultra High Frequency antenna that appears to be part of an Air Traffic Control radio-relay air-to-ground/telephone land-line interface point. these towers appear to be approximately 80-100' in HT and only 1 tower in each cluster has an operable red obstruction hazard light on its top. 2 of the somewhat shorter towers have what appears to be obstruction hazard lights on their tops but they are not operational. these towers do have; however; operating obstruction hazard lights at their midpoints. the last tower has no hazard warning lights at all. this situation has existed since at least 9/87 and I brought it to the attention of the casper Flight Service Station on about mid-10/87. these unlighted (or at least inadequately lighted) towers represent; in my judgement; a significant hazard to air navigate. they are situated on/very close to a major ARWY (V19) on a ridge crest; and in an area in which a significant amount of flight TRNING is conducted on a year round basis. in my judgement the simplest and most economical solution would be to return and maintain the installed lights to operational status and properly light the remaining tower.
