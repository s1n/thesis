WHILE taxiing for departure; we were told to hold short of runway 32. as we were stopping the aircraft short of runway 32; and control repeated their 'hold short' instructions. at that time we noticed that we had stopped short of the 'old' hold line; but were inside of the 'new' hold line. with the sun setting; the 'old' hold lines were at least as easy to see as the 'new' hold line because they had been painted over with a gloss paint.
