CLRED for Instrument Landing System approach; given a heading to intercept Instrument Landing System 23L at RDU. Navigational Aid was IDENTED (Instrument Landing System and Nondirectional Radio Beacon) on both #1 and #2 receivers; along with Nondirectional Radio Beacon. #3 receiver was tuned to RDU VFR Omni-Directional Radio Range; IDENTED and the Distance Measuring Equipment was held from the #2 for distance reference from VFR Omni-Directional Radio Range. just prior to outer marker we were handed off to tower. I questioned either approach or tower when I noted some fluctuations of the needle left and right which seemed strange with light winds (3 dots to full scale). as we chased the needle around it seemed like it may be returning to normal when at about 1000' Mean Sea Level it went full left and right. at that time I commanded my Fahrenheit/O to go around and at that moment we got ground contact and parts of the airport environment in sight. we continued to a normal landing. the problem was we were about halfway between the parallel runways; maybe as much as 1/8 of a mile to the right of the CENTERLINE of runway 23L. it seems that the only thing we could have done was to execute a missed at the first sign of problems; although this happens fairly often as you are just intercepting the Instrument Landing System and may cause false or unnecessary go around'S.
