OBTAINED standard briefing from ABQ Flight Service Station. one of the Global Positioning System NOTAMS was that 2 'PRN codes are unavailable.' I've got a PHD in engineering; so I know what a PRN code is and how to create one; but the Flight Service Station information was absolutely useless. which satellites and which Global Positioning System channels (Celsius/a) use those 2 PRN codes? what does this mean in terms of Global Positioning System availability and accuracy? briefer had no idea; and said that PRN codes was not even in his glossary. he also said that the Notice To Airmen came from the Federal Aviation Administration; and he had no idea what the Notice To Airmen meant. this Notice To Airmen is about as bad as they come -- something ISN't right; but we won't tell you what'S wrong; or if it even makes a difference.
