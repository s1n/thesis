EARLY morning (middle of the night) air ambiguity flight; single pilot. weather very good; Visual Meteorological Conditions entire trip. short (35 minute) leg each way to retrieve patient and bring back to ZZZ. on return leg to ZZZ; center cleared me to descend at discretion from FL210 to 16000 feet; approximately 80 Nautical Mile S of airport ZZZ. about 50 Nautical Mile S I began descent and advised center. about 40 Nautical Mile S; center asked me to contact approach on 118.3 (everything on tower frequency; this time of day XA00 local). I was listening to Automatic Terminal Information Service at the same time. I acknowledged center and continued to listen to Automatic Terminal Information Service which was advertising visuals to runway 03; which I was expecting. I reset my altitude ALERTER to indicate 'cleared for visual approach' erroneously. I checked in with tower and approach. told him I was descending for runway 3. when he asked my assigned altitude; I knew something was wrong. I was now about 14000 feet and last clearance was 16000 feet. uneventful approach and landing followed. no conflicts or loss of separation. primary factors: time of day: very tired; Federal Aviation Regulation below 100 percent mental alertness. it even took me a while to figure out what I had done. others: expectations and complacency. excellent weather; very familiar with all aspects of this flight. airport (and expected runway) in sight for a longitude time. I mentally repeated 'visual runway 3' when I heard it on Automatic Terminal Information Service and proceeded to do that; altitude wise. there was not a course deviation as the course to the VFR Omni-Directional Radio Range set me up for runway 3 (also a contributor). corrective: exercise extreme vigilance when operating aircraft at times you should be and normally would be sleeping. be alert for 'expectation errors' when everything is familiar.
