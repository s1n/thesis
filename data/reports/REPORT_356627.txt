ROANOKE tower was advised on dec/FRI/96; at XA00 local that our Automated Surface Observation System temperature and DEWPOINT was not accurate. the sensor had apparently been inaccurately RPTING all day. the National Weather Service told us that it was in error and they changed our weather display to show; 'missing' for the temperature and DEWPOINT. they also called someone to service the Automated Surface Observation System. the next morning; when I RPTED for the day shift (five and a half hours sleep due to forced quick turnaround; but that'S another story) I found that our air carrier FLTS could not depart because of the lack of weather information. after over an hour delay for one of the FLTS the air carrier obtained permission to use another weather source. the Automated Surface Observation System was not fixed until XH00 on dec/sat/96. several problems: 1) the equipment operated all day; sending out inaccurate information. I understood that temperature and DEWPOINTS are used in the forecasting models as well; therefore causing inaccurate forecasts to be generated. 2) after the technician could not be contacted; the National Weather Service was supposed to call a backup technician for this priority outage. they did not do this. 3) the maintenance technician said that the reason for the outage was lack of maintenance due to the fact that one of the technicians bid to another job and his spot was not filled. 4) while the technician worked on the equipment; he put it back on line and allowed it to disseminate inaccurate data -- that puts us back at item #1.
