LATE in what would be a 1 hour training flight in the pattern at san jose international airport; my student and I did a touch and go on runway 11 without clearance for the option. winds during the flight at the surface were variable from 130-210 degree at 9 Knots variable 16 Knots gusting to 21 Knots. winds aloft at pattern altitude of 1000 feet Mean Sea Level; were much stronger and a direct crosswind. needless to say; the patterns and LNDGS were difficult for my student and there was light turbulence on the downwind. I continued the flight; however; because my student was capable of handling the aircraft in these conditions and it was excellent experience for him. after approximately 4 touch and goes on runway 11; my student told me on the upwind that he thought we had not been cleared to land. he was right; we had not been cleared to land; or for the option; for that touch and go. I had completely forgotten and tower said nothing; so I told my student to say nothing over the radio and continue as before. tower cleared us for the option approaching OPS Base Operations Office on the next landing and the flight continued without further incident. while not too dangerous by itself; our UNCLRED landing was dangerous considering how busy the airport was. tower departed 1 aircraft off of runway 11 while we were on final; another was landing behind us; there was the usual steady stream of airline departures and ARRS on runway 12R; and several aircraft were stacked up on runway 12L for departure. tower simply forgot about that cessna in the pattern; and we forgot to get cleared to land as we were busy with the difficult patterns and watching for traffic. not exactly my finest moment as the all- powerful; student-mistake-catching Certified Flight Instructor.
