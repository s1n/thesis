AT 5000' being vectored for visibility to runway 10 at BWI; advised of traffic at 10 O'clock at 4200'. unable to spot traffic and asked again about his position. 11 O'clock climbing 4700' 1 1/2 mile. (converging course) I asked for vectors away; at same time I spotted traffic coming towards us. Air Traffic Control advised a left turn. I was already in a descending right turn and advised Air Traffic Control of such. we missed by about 1/4 mile or so. would've hit the SMA otherwise. SMA was climbing through our altitude coming at us from 11 O'clock. Air Traffic Control provided no indication of converging except to tell us he (other aircraft) was E-NE bound; then provided bad turn. did not seem concerned. SMA was within Terminal Control Area limits. controller workload appeared very light.
