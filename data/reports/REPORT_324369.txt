WHILE descending through 3500 feet on V334 approximately 10 Nautical Mile NE of the san jose VFR Omni-Directional Radio Range I suddenly saw a light twin aircraft; light blue and white in color; probably a beech dutchess; crossing in my 10-11 O'clock position; at my altitude left to right and at a distance of about 1000 feet. I made an immediate descending sharp left turn as an evasive maneuver. I passed behind and under the twin at a minimum distance of about 300 feet. I was in radar flight following and had been advised of traffic at 12 O'clock 4500 feet; 1 mile; same direction moments prior to this. after RPTING the near miss; I was told by the controller that he saw no traffic at my altitude. I assured him that there indeed was traffic. facts/opinions: had I not made the immediate maneuver I am convinced we would have collided. I am very committed to continuous scanning for traffic and was distracted by the advisory I was given and so failed to look left at that time in particular. I would guess the twin was 'sneaking through' the class Celsius and maybe nearby class B airspace by not activating his transponder. only other explanation is controller missed return or there is a radar blind spot in this area and altitude unless twin was replying with altitude 1000 feet in error.
