TAKING off using 'dial-a-flap' setting of 24 degree. when throttles were advanced for takeoff; false 'slat' aural warning sounded. rejected takeoff at less than 20 Knots. taxied clear of runway and reset flap/slat handle and 'dial-a-flap' wheel. subsequent takeoff was uneventful. this is an aggravating anomaly of the MLG when using flap setting of 24 degree for takeoff. callback conversation with RPTR revealed the following information. 24 degree flap is used when the aircraft is very light. company is aware of the problem and is considering discontinuing the use of 24 degree. RPTR stated that when conditions warrant the use of 24 degree he has the Fahrenheit/O set 23 degree or very carefully position the selector to 24. the more normal flap setting of 15 degree is used for the heavier takeoff weights and is primarily based on sec segment climb performance.
