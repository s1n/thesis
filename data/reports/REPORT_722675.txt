THE normal Instrument Landing System approach to runway 5R is not available and smog/fog is at or near minimums for the non-Instrument Landing System approach. clearance is to fly the VFR Omni-Directional Radio Range runway 5R. at minimums the aircraft is lined up with runway 5L and it is the closest and most prominent runway in sight. runway 5R is more distant and not nearly as visible! we IDENTED and initially lined up with runway 5L. the Head Up Display was also lined up with runway 5L. when we got tower we saw the error and corrected. as we taxied in we saw 2 other ARRS make the same mistake. this is going to bite somebody; it is extremely insidious!
