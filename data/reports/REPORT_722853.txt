WE had been cleared for a visual approach to runway 27 at san. this after initially arriving via the BARET four arrival Standard Instrument Departure. night and severe clear. initially we were given a clearance to proceed direct to swatt intersection and intercept the localizer. subsequently we received (accepted) a visual approach clearance. the Captain (the Pilot Flying) elected to remain on the direct to swatt track (IE; we'LL just remain on this heading until we intercept). the Captain called for the altitude to be set to 3600 feet for swatt. I set this in the Flight Control Unit window. as we descended through about 5000 feet I stated that the current heading would take us over some terrain and obstacles that are charted at 2791 feet. these features were visual and at 12 O'clock position. there is terrain with radio towers situated on top. at about 4500 feet the Captain decreased the rate of descent; and at about 4000 feet the descent rate was minimal -- maybe 200 Feet Per Minute down. the EGPWS display was displaying light green -- corresponding to the terrain ahead. as the aircraft passed over the top of the obstacles we received a Ground Proximity Warning System mode 2A warning: 'terrain; terrain...pull up; pull up.' the Captain applied toga power and began a pitch up. almost immediately the warning ceased -- and the warning lights extinguished. the aircraft had really not even responded (yet) to the commanded maneuver (IE; it happened so fast beginning to end). the Captain retarded the throttles and we proceeded to a successful visual approach and landing. I believe that the rate of closure with the rising terrain -- though not in our actual flight path -- generated the Ground Proximity Warning System warning.
