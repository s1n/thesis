PHX runway 8 shortened by 5000 feet. our carrier does not have performance data for the shortened runway. Automatic Terminal Information Service advised us to inform them if unable to use runway 8. we advised on initial contact. other than sequencing problems for approach; there were no conflicts as we were cleared for a visual to runway 7R. as we taxied in; we were asked to call the Terminal Radar Approach Control Facility supervisor and given a phone number to copy. I have always felt that the taxi was an inappropriate time to tell a crew to call the Federal Aviation Administration! my First Officer had difficulty putting it behind him as we taxied to the gate. this is not any time for DISTRS. the Federal Aviation Administration can certainly wait until the aircraft is in the chocks to play policeman.
