UPON arrival to van NUYS airport; crew wrote up right nose taxi light and Minimum Equipment List'ed it. subsequent conversation Light Emitting Diode to the discovery that maintenance control in ZZZ1 did not have on record two of the Minimum Equipment List'ed items posted in our status book. subsequent review of those items Light Emitting Diode to the discovery that one of our items was past the extension date posted by maintenance on dec/sat/03. the aircraft was scheduled for maintenance on dec/wed/03. no indication on the aircraft status sheet faxed for the 2 FLTS prior to leaving the aircraft in maintenance on dec/TUE/03; indicated the expiration of the Minimum Equipment List'ed item. the crew is trained to review the status book and status sheet when accepting the aircraft on a crew swap. I originally found all documentation in order on that date (dec/sun/03). I failed to notice and query the 'B' item in question. when speaking with the lead mechanic on dec/wed/03; we expected return to service (rts) about XA00Z on jan/thu/03. upon reviewing Minimum Equipment List forms during rts (15) I missed the maintenance facility'S failure to extend or review the now expired 'B' item with me or maintenance control in ZZZ1. in my estimation; ZZZ1 had knowledge of and had extended with concurrence of the lead. I was told 'we were unable to fix item and left it Minimum Equipment List'ed. when I reviewed the open item on Minimum Equipment List status; I failed to see the original dec/wed/03. I had read they swapped gauges only and taken for granted (that was at PHX after consult with lead mechanic). my opinion is that crews depend on ZZZ1 control as much as they depend on us. this started before I took over the aircraft. (Minimum Equipment List not in system)? failure of maintenance at 3 facilities to correct squawk and scheduling pressure for 'rts' and drastic time shifts in crew duty.
