PREVIOUS flight arrived from ZZZ with an Minimum Equipment List signed off. this Minimum Equipment List referred to 1 brake being inoperative and disconnected. after reading the Minimum Equipment List procedures; the pilot procedures were specified in the procedures column. all pilot-required steps were taken and all close-out penalties were applied. maintenance was to inspect the landing gear generators. this was noted on the previous log page as being performed in ZZZ. neither the log page nor did the Minimum Equipment List page state a maintenance SIGNOFF was required before each flight. maintenance failed to sign off the logbook stating they had checked the landing gear TAC generators. maintenance control was contacted in ZZZ1 and I was advised that maintenance control dropped the ball and did not notify ZZZ2 that they were to perform the inspection. aircraft was inspected and signed off. Minimum Equipment List should have stated in the pilot column that a signed off log sheet be required before each flight. it did not.
