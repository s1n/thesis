WHILE boarding; the #1 flight attendant advised me that we had a drunk passenger in row x. in a very short time the #2 flight attendant advised me that he was a problem and that she wanted him off the plane. I called the ramp tower and asked for police and the proper people. he left the airplane peacefully and I don't know what happened after that. the agent working the flight was very helpful. all in all; this was no big deal except for 1 major problem. I later found out that the guy was so drunk that he had to be helped on the airplane by the passenger assistance people. I don't mean our agents -- who of course would know better -- but the people that push the wheelchairs and drive the carts. someone needs to counsel these people that while their job may be to assist passenger; it is not to assist drunk passenger on the airplanes. I feel that if a guy is too drunk to walk on the airplane; then he is too drunk to ride for 2 1/2 hours on the same full airplane.
