WHILE crossing runway 4; we were given a left turn onto taxiway BB; hold short of taxiway Y. I glanced at taxiway BB from the airport diagram and noted no RESTRS. my focus of attention was redirected back to visual taxi lookout. when stopped and holding short of taxiway Y; as directed by ground control; we noticed that while there is no restrict for B757'S on taxiway BB; there is a restrict from turning either direction off of taxiway BB. in other words; it is a dead-end for B757'S. the Captain called the chief pilot on duty and discussed the situation. we were informed that if we could safely taxi with wing walkers we could proceed from taxiway BB; left on taxiway Y then left on taxiway AA. this we did with port authority/authorized wing walkers and at no time was there a question of adequate wing clearance. the chief pilot on call was a tremendous help. I recommend a note be added on the airport page restricting B757'S from even turning onto taxiway BB; left from taxiway D. LGA taxiing is very tight; quick and dynamic and requires outside safety lookout at all times.
