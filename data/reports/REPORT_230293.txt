WHEN we attempted a takeoff from runway 21 at CHS; the First Officer was flying. V1 was 101 Knots. upon reaching approximately 95 Knots; the #2 engine started to bypass fuel; resulting in a loss of between 10-15 percent torque. this caused a noticeable yaw to the right. the First Officer called 'malfunction.' I called 'reject' and took command of the airplane. we instructed CHS tower we wished to taxi back to conduct a run-up. during the run-up; all engine parameters were normal and the previous condition could not be reproduced. we proceeded with another takeoff and completed it successfully.
