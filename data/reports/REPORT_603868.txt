I was landing at GLE at about XA00 jan/XA/04. the Automated Weather Observation System and NOTAMS indicated a displaced threshold of 1000 feet for runway 17. there were wooden barricades (about 4 feet high) with chevron markers indicating the area where workers were doing runway maintenance. on landing; there were several workers standing about 20 feet to each side of the CTRLINE; but remained standing on the usable part of the runway. I extended my flare over them. I believe they should be clear of the active part of the runway; or the barricaded area should have been extended to include the runway areas where they were working. I believe their lives were in danger. they were standing at the 'new' threshold marking; which was about 100 feet past the barricades. on departure; I was back-taxiing to reach the beginning of the runway; so as to use all the available runway. once again; I passed the workers; milling around on the runway; towards the barricades. after passing them; I noticed they had been painting a new threshold line (on the active part of the runway). one of the workers who was on the local Common Traffic Advisory Frequency yelled at me to turn around and clear the area. I complied and departed. summary: the problem/danger I see here is that; while they are working on the new markings; they are not protected in any way. PROCEDURALLY; it may make more sense to include the area they were marking within the barricaded area. once the lines are marked; the barricades could be moved further back to only include the area being resurfaced. the partial markings were not sufficient to protect them. on landing; the workers on the runway were past the newly painted 'WIP' area -- presenting a danger to themselves and pilots. perhaps some training in avoiding landing planes would be appropriate.
