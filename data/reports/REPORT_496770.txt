FLYING a very old and very basic LEARJET 23 with very basic navigate equipment. we were cleared to cross PHIGG intersection at 11000 feet and 250 Knots Indicated Airspeed. we were using the Distance Measuring Equipment to identify PHIGG (3 Distance Measuring Equipment off BLD). the Distance Measuring Equipment was the old type where you must tune it to the frequency -- it does not tune off of #1 or #2 navigate. we had it tuned to las and missed our altitude by approximately 5000 feet. Air Traffic Control brought this to our attention and I told them what happened. the distances were close enough that it WASN't obvious we had the wrong frequency. obviously a result of not paying close attention. the Global Positioning System was so basic we WEREN't using it as a backup for distance.
