AFTER pushing from gate; ground contacted us with taxi instructions to runway 9L; via taxiway B; taxiway A6; taxiway J to runway 9L. we entered taxiway B at taxiway A4. when we made the left turn onto taxiway B; we saw an aircraft approaching from the opposite direction. we stopped and asked ground for clarification. apparently the controller had wanted us to use taxiway E to join taxiway B. we were issued new taxi instructions and proceeded to runway 9L without incident. because ground frequency in ord is so busy it is often difficult to read back taxi instructions. in retrospect; we should have read back the clearance to insure compliance. this would have eliminated any misunderstanding. perhaps use of coded taxi RTES could also eliminate confusion. the First Officer is aware of this report I am filing. again; I believe one of the major issues here is how to effectively communicate when Air Traffic Control is so congested. although it takes radio time; I will be reading back all taxi clearance in full.
