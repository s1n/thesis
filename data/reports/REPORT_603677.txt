CLRNC was radar vectored to TRALR Area Navigation one departure. takeoff runway 1R; initial clearance was climb to 7000 feet vector 050 degree. first Air Traffic Control vector after handoff from tower was 100 degree. then; 'climb to FL190; comply with RESTRS; vector 060 degree.' we tried to query what restrict Air Traffic Control controller was referring to. B-700 model navigate display showed us heading nearly directly to 'NAPSE' which has an 'at or below 7000 feet restrict.' we decided until we could get an answer to what restrict he was talking about; we would maintain 7000 feet until abeam NAPSE and then climb. about the time we were abeam NAPSE; the controller answered our question -- that there was no restrict on a radar vector. the manner and tone of the controller was as if we were total idiots. moments later; he had issued the same; 'comply with RESTRS' to another air carrier. this guy asked the same question we did; and added; 'why are you saying comply with RESTRS if there are none?' the controller answered; 'because I have to.' this controller was confusing everyone. if there are no RESTRS; then why is he saying; 'comply with RESTRS?' he is creating his own problems; and then the frequency becomes congested with everyone trying to figure out what to do. callback conversation with RPTR revealed the following information: RPTR has not returned to las since this event. RPTR is aware that theirs and other company inquiries have resulted in the Federal Aviation Administration researching areas for clarification. RPTR believes that the phrase 'comply with RESTRS' can only be executed with altitude crossing RESTRS.
