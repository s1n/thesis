I was taxiing on SC and I had received a taxi clearance from ground to taxi to AA via taxiway Mach Number. SC markings were covered with snow and taxiway CTRLINE lighting was also invisible. as I searched for the CTRLINE an aircraft was going n on taxiway Mach Number from taxiway a. at this point I was not quite to taxiway left. the snow started blowing and reduced my visibility; not sure if it was caused by the wind or propeller wash. as I concentrated to find center I saw green CTRLINE lighting; made the left-hand turn inadvertently ending up on runway 35L. I never saw the wig wags guarding runway 35L; after I made my left-hand turn; the runway lighting DIDN't register until ground asked my position. I took the first reverse high speed from there to exit the runway. because of when I picked up the green CTRLINE lighting and I never saw the wig wags; I thought I was still on SC; and not M2.
