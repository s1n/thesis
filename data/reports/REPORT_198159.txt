I had been taking instrument instruction for approximately 1 1/2 hours; with approaches the main training. we landed. the instructor left for another student. I took off from E at kansas city airport and made an approach for independence airport. landing gear stuck half way down resulting in damage on impact. if landing gear light was in more visible spot; might have gone around and hand cranked gear down.
