AS we were taking off on runway 9L at ord; shortly before reaching V1; I noticed an air carrier MLG Y taxiing se on the 14L parallel at a high rate of speed. he was approaching runway 9L. we were going much too fast to stop; and I doubted he was going to. about that time tower said; 'MLG Y hold you position.' (I don't remember his number.) there was no response from MLG Y. the next call from tower showed a lot of anxiety when he said; 'MLG Y; stop!' MLG Y then stopped a short distance from runway 9L as we went by. the MLG Y pilot; with a catch in his voice; asked tower if he was told to hold short. I and my crew are in disagreement as to the tower'S response. because of the stress of the moment; we all seem to have heard something else. we don't know if the tower said; 'yes; and we expect you to respond;' or if tower said; 'no; but we expect you to respond when we call you.' we were too busy at the time to pay a lot of attention. I did go into my rotation when I saw MLG Y and got in the air; and would have cleared him; but it would have been extremely close.
