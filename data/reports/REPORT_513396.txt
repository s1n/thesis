LOCATION: radar downwind SNA runway 19R. on radar downwind at 5000 feet and 190 Knots; I saw 2 Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System II targets approximately 5 mile on my nose -- 1 co-altitude; and the other 400-500 feet below my altitude. they were moving straight at my aircraft. I announced to the SOCAL controller a traffic conflict existed on my nose; co-altitude. he gave me a right turn to 170 degree. as I started the turn; Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System II announced 'traffic; traffic' on the co-altitude target. as I started the turn; I XCHKED the Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System II and knew that this was going to be close. I tightened up the turn by going to approximately 45 degree of bank. the aircraft announced 'bank angle; bank angle' -- possibly blocking a Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System II Resolution Advisory. as best as I can determine; I was within approximately 1 1/2 mile of the co-altitude target during the turn. oddly; the controller DIDN't believe the separation was much of a problem. a telephonic debrief with the SOCAL supervisor on duty was made after landing.
