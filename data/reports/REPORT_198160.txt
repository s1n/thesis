AFTER takeoff on 27R; departure control gave us 'left turn to 180 degree climb to 14000.' during the turn passing 10000; Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System II gave Traffic Advisory; then Resolution Advisory 'descend.' we had traffic visually at 2 O'clock; about 5 mile; slightly high. at about same time as Resolution Advisory; departure asked if we had been assigned 10000. we replied 'no; 14000.' when queried; controller could not recall if he had issued clearance to 10000 or 14000. traffic passed off our right about 5 mile; no conflict.
