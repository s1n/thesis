IN this part of the country ZOB will give you radar advisories only to a certain point E of the western shore of lake ST clair. for some reason; they cannot hand you off to detroit approach while they are giving you Visual Flight Rules radar advisories. they have you squawk Visual Flight Rules 1200 and on your own to contact detroit approach. this leaves you very near if not almost in 3 actual time Of arrival'S while descending for an uncontrolled field in the area; while trying to contact detroit approach immediately -- and they are usually very busy. an Instrument Flight Rules clearance was then requested. Air Traffic Control took some time to get one while still flying through the area. a visual approach was issued and Instrument Flight Rules cancelled. I think that the 2 Air Traffic Control FACS should coordinate together so that Visual Flight Rules aircraft receiving radar advisories will not be put in this tight situation. also departing WBOUND Air Traffic Control will not always answer or keep advising you to contact other approach or departure controllers for Visual Flight Rules advisories while you are climbing to avoid actual time Of arrival'S and almost in if not already over the canada border line over the lake before a controller gives you a squawk code and Visual Flight Rules advisories.
