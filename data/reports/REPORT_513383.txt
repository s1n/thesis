HOLDING short of runway 8R in vancouver; back course; prior to departure; our flight attendant called advising there was smoke coming from our right wheel well. while the First Officer was speaking to the flight attendant; the tower called advising of smoke coming from the #2 engine. I called for the engine fire/shutdown on ground checklist. the flight attendant called back saying there were now flames. at the same time the tower called and advised there was fire on our #2 side and the trucks were on the way. I declared an emergency. we ran the engine fire/shutdown on ground checklist and told the passenger to evacuate/evacuation out the main cabin door through which they entered. they evacuated on the #1 side of the aircraft. the First Officer and I finished the checklist and followed the passenger and flight attendant out. the vancouver fire department did a fabulous job helping us. it turned out that the brake on the #2 side caught fire and the flight attendant and tower believed it was the engine.
