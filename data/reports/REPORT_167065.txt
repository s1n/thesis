AFTER a normal takeoff from JHM; we climbed to approximately 1500' Mean Sea Level. before starting a crosswind turn to the left; Fahrenheit/O and I carefully cleared the area to the right; ahead; and to the left. then Fahrenheit/O started a left turn to our crosswind. our CLBOUT heading was approximately 030 degree. Fahrenheit/O had completed approximately 100 degree of turn to a heading of about 290 degree when the incident occurred. a single engine aircraft crossed from our 3 O'clock across to our 11 O'clock; above us and moving to our left. the pilot did not make radio contact with JHM UNICOM until later. he had crossed the airport'S runway'S CENTERLINE; until he had crossed our crosswind departure line; and not until he had almost hit us. he stated over the radio that he never saw us. I advised him to contact UNICOM earlier in his RTING to do more to avoid this sort of thing. he was moving from behind us and at a higher speed and never saw us. if he had used his radio and his eyes more fully; we could have been safer and better able to avoid this sort of very dangerous conduct.
