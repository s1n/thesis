WE were cleared to land on runway 35L at dia. the weather was 600 feet overcast with a visibility of between 1/2 and 1 mile. the approach was briefed for category 1; with the First Officer as the Pilot Flying. while the aircraft descended crossing the threshold; the denver tower instructed us to go around. both pilots at that same time observed the METROLINER aircraft in the touchdown zone of runway 35L. the Pilot Flying advanced the throttles to toga and applied full back pressure on the controls. a successful go around was completed and we landed on runway 35R. due to the aircraft size; low visibility and blowing snow; the METROLINER was impossible to see until we were directly upon it. the saving factors were good training; flying the approach as category 1; not category 3 where pilot'S attentions are more inside focused and an alert tower controller. I feel that the crew could not have done anything different. the other party should not have been on the runway without proper clearance.
