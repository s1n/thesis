DURING taxi to runway for takeoff; nothing unusual or any problems with the NOSEWHEEL steering were observed. taxi route was ramp; exit J5; left on taxiway J; right on taxiway Fahrenheit; left on taxiway k; runway 27. lots of different turns. during the takeoff; the First Officer was hitting the runway CTRLINE lights but moved over to the right of CTRLINE to avoid hitting them. no indications present. after liftoff and gear selected 'up;' we received master warning 'nose door open; gear disagreement' master caution 'weight on wheels input; NOSEWHEEL steering' status message 'weight on wheels output fail.' First Officer took control of the radios while I ran the Quick Reference Handbook procedure for nose door open 13-9 which called for the gear to be selected down. this cleared all master warnings and I got 3 green gear down and locked. continued with the checklist and talked to maintenance control; dispatch; First Officer; flight attendant; passenger and Air Traffic Control. checklist complete. vectored onto runway localizer runway 18R. cleared for visual approach because gear was down and locked. I did not declare an emergency and a normal landing was made. when turning the NOSEWHEEL; steering failed and after talking to maintenance control; taxied to spot on taxiway E to ramp. ramp agent met us with a tug and tow bar. agent noticed scissors were not connected and reconnected the scissors. I then taxied to gate where I was met by MECHS. deplaned the aircraft. talked to the MECHS. no damage found. apparently sometime during the takeoff run; the scissors had become disconnected which caused the return to the airport.
