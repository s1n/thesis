WE were eastbound on J-8 to pails intersection. we had approximately 150K of tailwind in cruise (IE; very high ground speed). we were given clearance to cross 25 Nautical Mile W of dupont VFR Omni-Directional Radio Range at 24000'. the clearance came very late based on our ground speed. we started an immediate descent (from 33000') and had only reached FL310 when 25 Nautical Mile W of dupont. center was aware of the problem and gave us much more advanced warning of future crossing restrictions. since the flight was late in the evening and the winds had been high all day; I feel we could have been given more advanced warning of the first crossing restriction. I have seldom experienced such high tailwinds in flight; so perhaps I could have told center we wanted to start down early or perhaps tell them we would have a problem getting to the crossing altitude. supplemental information from ACN 80117: we were in cruise at FL330 with a 150 Knot direct tailwind and DIDN't plan our descent correctly to meet altitude restriction. supplemental information from ACN 80490: we had a 150K tailwind and DIDN't plan our descent correctly.
