I was on a pleasure flight in a rented SMA with passenger; flying direct to keene; NH; from mansfield; ma; (1B9). I overflew worcester airport at 2200' Mean Sea Level; believing it to be fitchburg airport; my first major CHKPOINT. as I arrived there sooner then expected; I checked in my airport directory; noted that the runways were different and at that time realized I was S of course and over a controled field. I put down at orange; ma; and checked my flight plan and realized I had forgotten to include the magnetic variation in my computations. I was also too absorbed in close terrain features and did not see the larger picture.
