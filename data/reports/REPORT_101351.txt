EVENT: struck right landing light on MLG due to wing low attitude in landing flare. Captain flying aircraft. crew on duty since previous evening flying DFW-ONT-DFW. third straight night trip out of 3 in a row. during 2 hour and 15 minute situation around in ONT; no rest FACS provided by company. crew meals scheduled ONT-DFW; but not placed on board. snack bar/restaurant closed at ONT. fatigue a very large factor in this incident. Captain was restrict (less than 300 hours in aircraft) so required higher (1800 Runway Visual Range) minimums. AUTOLAND (category III) not authority/authorized for this Captain. I flew entire approach using flight guidance system to decision height (200'). all parameters normal. air carrier Y MLG landed with 5 mile RPTED spacing in front of us. at 200' Captain called 'approach lights in sight.' at 150' he disconnected the Auto-Pilot and AUTOTHROTTLES. immediately we went 1 Department Of Transportation high and slightly left. I continued calls per company procedure. at just under 100' he corrected; but lined up left of CENTERLINE. we floated to approximately 3000' down runway where turbulence from landing aircraft and drift correction allowed a momentary 10 degree right bank angle. Captain leveled aircraft and landed. right landing light destroyed from ground impact. all NIGHTERS should have mandatory meal/rest requirements. a minimum standard is needed. the Captain'S low time in the aircraft (147 hours); plus inadequate rest and nutrition all contributed.
