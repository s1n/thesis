60 gallons 'jet a' fuel added to left wing during refueling on stop over. someone asked if we used jet fuel. I said; 'no; why?' company was contacted and it was decided to drain the left wing and all drains. 20 more gallons were added and drained. more fuel added and sample appeared normal. wing was refueled. engines were started and run for 20 minutes. engine RUNUP was uneventful as was return trip to oxnard; CA. complacency and inattention to the job at hand are the causes of this incident. the FUELER learned that all large a/Celsius do not take jet fuel and I once again was reminded that people don't always know how to do the job to which they are assigned.
