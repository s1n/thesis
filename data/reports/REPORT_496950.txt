GIVEN clearance to cross DALAS intersection at 14000 feet. Vertical Navigation was programmed appropriately and at 20 Distance Measuring Equipment before programmed top of descent; I started down. at top of descent point; aircraft pitched down as if to descend normally. I went about other duties and noticed at FL300 we were 18 mile from DALAS intersection. we crossed at approximately FL200. during the whole exercise; the Vertical Navigation indicated all was normal. closer attention to the descent profile would have alerted me to the inability of Vertical Navigation to stay on profile. the presence of a jump seat rider may have contributed to my inattentiveness. again; closer attention to duties would have prevented this.
