BEGINNING with the loading of the aircraft. according to the cargo load report; bin #2 was overloaded by 90 pounds. the passenger placement CONFIGN was also out of envelope parameters which was initially indicated by the first center of gravity computation. the Captain was informed of the problem and responded immediately for correction. the flight continued normally from taxi to approach. during the intermediate approach portion I did ask the Captain when he was going to blow the boots. he indicated that 1/4-1/2 inch ice was not significant enough to cycle the boots. final approach fix was reached and before landing check complete. I again queried the Captain on blowing the boots. he again indicated there was no need. the approach continued to the landing flare at which point I initiated back pressure for round off of the flare. the plane responded slightly; as I continued to exert back pressure for the flare. the plane landed hard with structural failure of the right main gear. we skidded and braked to a complete stop on the right side of the runway. the plane was shut down and evacuated. no fatalities or injuries.
