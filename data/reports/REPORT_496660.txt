RELIEVED previous controller. air carrier flight progress strip had no altitude entry; and standard altitude should have been 5000 feet. Visual Flight Rules aircraft was level at 5500 feet. conflict alert went off. checked with previous controller about air carrier altitude assignment. controller said 9000 feet. I stopped the air carrier at 5000 feet. due to new scopes and Automated Radar Terminal Systems overlap; was unable to discern altitude of air carrier.
