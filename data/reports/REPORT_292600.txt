DEPARTING IAD while being vectored to BUFFR intersection center issued a Traffic Advisory and then a climb from 7000 feet to 10000 feet. the Captain had the traffic in sight. since the aircraft was relatively light we had a higher than usual climb rate which resulted in a Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System II advisory to reduce climb. after passing well clear of the other aircraft; the controller asked if we were at 7000 feet. we advised that we had read back a clearance to 10000 feet. it seems likely that the controller had mistaken us for another company aircraft with a similar call sign. the controller then cleared the aircraft with the similar call sign to 10000 feet and cleared us on up to 17000 feet. the flight was completed uneventfully.
