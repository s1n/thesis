WE were running late and in a hurry; already 8 hours into our scheduled 11 hour 20 minute crew day; we were trying to recover time lost earlier in the day. the First Officer needed something to Expected Approach Time so while he was getting dinner I got our outbound clearance (usually the First Officer'S responsibility) and read back our clearance for the summa 5 departure. upon the First Officer'S return I briefed him that we were cleared by the ELMMA 5 departure. neither of us caught the error; although; while I was reviewing ELMMA 5 I questioned in my mind the routing (I did not ask the First Officer his opinion of our routing; which probably would have caught my error). we departed using the ELMMA departure; and upon making our turn out of the airport area; seattle approach IDENTED our error and asked if we were flying the summa 5. we immediately realized our error and graciously accepted his vector toward our course. no conflict with other aircraft occurred and seattle departure did an excellent job of controling the situation. two unfortunately typical things contributed to this event. 1) we (I) let the schedule influence our decisions. 2) when I first questioned our routing I did not verbalize my concern to the First Officer. if we had slowed our pace and performed our normal duties the confusion would have been avoided.
