I had just finished a phantom approach with a stall. I increased power and climbed approximately to 5000 feet above ground level. I experienced loss of thrust followed by a knocking -- buzzing noise that progressed into violent shaking of the aircraft. I first leveled the aircraft; then went through emergency procedures. I throttled back and flew the airplane at 80 Knots; but the aircraft was still violently shaking. I tried to dial 121.5 and could not. I prepared to make an immediate landing. we spotted a field at our 2 O'clock and I set up for an approach. while setting up for the landing; I pulled the mixture full lean and increased the power to 1500 Revolutions Per Minute to kill the engine; but the engine would not quit. I throttled back and slipped the plane until 20 feet above ground level. I straightened the plane and did a 2 point landing; let the nose wheel down; and applied brakes. the engine would not shut down; so I turned the magnetic switch off when the Revolutions Per Minute fluctuated to its slowest cycle. it WASN't till after the engine shut down; that I then noticed that the propeller was missing 5 inches off the tip. then I made contact with WJF.
