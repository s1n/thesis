ONTARIO approach controller told us 'cleared for the approach' over PDZ VFR Omni-Directional Radio Range. later he told us to contact march GCA controller; which we did. (approach was hemet ryan Nondirectional Radio Beacon-a). march GCA controller told us to notify him when we were inbound on the approach. current position was 10-15 mile from the Initial Approach Fix; so I responded 'wilco.' 5 minutes later march GCA controller said; 'confirm you are inbound on the approach.' we were inbound to the Initial Approach Fix; so I responded; 'affirmative.' some time later the march controller said; 'continue you are inbound to hemet.' I said; 'affirmative;' then he said we were E of course; approaching mountains! after a climb and turn; he gave us vectors to the airport; where we landed W/O incident. apparently he knew we were off course all 3 times he said 'confirm you are inbound.' he should have said something more definite like; 'you appear to be E of course;' or 'you are 10 mile E of SETER intersection' that would have IDENTED and corrected the situation earlier.
