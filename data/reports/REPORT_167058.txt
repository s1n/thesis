I experienced complete electrical failure over a solid overcast layer. this was due to alternator failure and battery drain. after estimating my position and descending to the Minimum Enroute Altitude (2400') and remaining Instrument Meteorological Conditions; I initiated a climb above the overcast layer and made a 180 degree turn to return to the last known Visual Flight Rules conditions. after Visual Flight Rules conditions found; I followed an interstate in attempting to find the closest airport (gadsden; al). after manually cranking down the gear; we were able to land safely at gadsden; and notify the nearest Flight Service Station by phone of the situation and action taken. until this problem; I was unaware that a very slight discharge shown on the ammeter will result in a batter discharge. the alternator/electrical system had supposedly been repaired in asheville; NC prior to departure. the use of a hand-held navigate/communication unit could have enabled me to continue the Instrument Flight Rules flight with course guidance and communication.
