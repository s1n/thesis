I was 'holding short' runway 8R awaiting takeoff clearance. tower controller (120.90) came on and said; taxi into position and hold. I read 'back position and hold runway 8R.' on the way to the runway; tower controller said; amend instructions; fly runway heading maintain 4000 feet cleared for takeoff. I read back the instructions and proceeded with the takeoff. on CLBOUT; tower controller said there had been a Pilot Deviation and he gave me the phone number to call when I landed. I phoned phoenix tower and I discussed the situation. he indicated to me that I was not cleared for takeoff and that the READBACK of my clearance was 'stepped on' by another aircraft. said that the Flight Standards District Office would investigate the incident and that I would be contacted at a later date. I would never blatantly disregard an Federal Aviation Regulation and takeoff without a takeoff clearance.
