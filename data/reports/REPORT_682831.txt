YVR approach informed us on initial contact of moderate turbulence below 8000 feet in vicinity of airport. they also advised us of WINDSHEAR of 5-10 Knots RPTED at or around 1000 feet above ground level. on approach; we had a good ride until turning OPS Base Operations Office descending through 3000 feet for 2000 feet. cleared the approach to runway 8L. got continual moderate turbulence on approach with +15 to -5 Knots. surface winds were 090 degree at 12 Knots. winds at our altitude 040 degree at 25 Knots. in Visual Flight Rules conditions at 1000 feet; we got a +20 Knots followed by a loss of 10 Knots. I applied maximum power to get AIRSPD back. simultaneously; got Autopilot and Flight Director System WINDSHEAR warning. hand flying approach; applied power and began to go around when AIRSPD recovered and we flew through the WINDSHEAR. having not yet climbed above Glideslope and all indications appeared normal; elected to continue approach to a normal landing. flight below the 1000 feet was smooth. I did not elect to do WINDSHEAR recovery profile for several reason: 1) no convective activity. 2) shear was a wind event. 3) altitude above ground. 4) aircraft returned to a normal state. we had a short night the evening before in OKC. due to computer outage; we arrived OKC at XA30. got to sleep around XB30. woke up 6 hours later. fatigue may have had a minor impact on decision.
