WHILE taxiing to runway 21C for takeoff; we used the inner and transitioned to the outer 'x' at O3. the yellow 'outer-x' signs are located on the E side of 'outer-x' but adjacent and prior to runway 21C. they CLRLY indicate that 21C is the outer-x! less than 1/2 mile farther down the runway 2 air carrier Y jets collided after one became confused at the TAXIWAY/runway markings and entered the active runway! after entering the TAXIWAY I asked ground to verify that we were actually on the outer. he replied that we were and that those signs are 'kind of confusing' out there! they are not confusing! they CLRLY are wrong! lucky for us it was clear. the air carrier Y crews did not enjoy the good visibility. this is another accident waiting to happen.
