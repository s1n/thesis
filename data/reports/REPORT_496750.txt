WE both understood that we were cleared for visual approach runway 33L at BWI. First Officer read back 'cleared visual approach runway 33L.' after our left turn direct to the outer marker for runway 33L at BWI; controller asked where we were going. we said 'cleared visual runway 33L direct to outer marker.' controller said we were to expect visual approach runway 33L; but not cleared for it. we got a turn about 45 degree to the right for about 4 mile then cleared for visual approach runway 33L at BWI. we DIDN't think we did anything wrong at all. but the controller did.
