JUST as they finished deicing our aircraft (A320) we received an aft cargo smoke warning. this warning was triggered by deicing fumes and the deicing process. a quick response by the ground crew to check the cargo area and confirm there was no smoke/fire prevented this from escalating into a ground emergency situation. this is a problem on the A320 -- deicing fluid gets by the cargo door seals setting off the warning. if the ground crew is not immediately available the crew must assume that it'S a real cargo smoke warning for something other than deicing. this has also occurred at the gate with an aircraft deicing at the next gate.
