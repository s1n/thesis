THE problem was caused by the PA18 using the crosswind runway and not flying at the correct altitude for the pattern. it was discovered by myself on CLBOUT by the PA18 getting bigger in my windshield. the corrective action taken was I went into a dive to avoid. also; communication on his radio was static and hard to understand. wherever 2 traffic patterns overlap; there is a chance of this.
