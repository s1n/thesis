FIRST; I am an Instrument Flight Rules flight instructor and know better than to let this happen. I had just purchased this airplane and was delayed getting airborne after a lengthy PREFLT. up to this point I had been flying full Instrument Flight Rules panel aircraft; daily. this plane had only an ill-functioning 720 communication and mode Celsius transponder; no navigate equipment. I was dead-reckoning to a maintenance facility in Public Address (haven't done that in a while) while my attention was trying to get my communication radio functioning. I drifted too close to DCA area. I thought I was under class B limitations; area published is 10000 feet/4500 feet. I am very comfortable communicating with Air Traffic Control and make it a priority INFLT so as to avoid this very thing. my error was focusing too longitude on trying to get my communication radio working while piloting an aircraft; I was solo. I realized my error visually and immediately made corrections in dead-reckoning to avoid this class B airspace. dead-reckoning became my priority as I flew past the DCA area; fredericks (FDK) and prohibited area P-40. I then refocused my attention on radios after passing littlestown; Public Address; and got my radio functioning by york; Public Address (THV). lancaster control tower was the agency that told me to contact potomac radar. I was then informed that the IAD Terminal Control Area was active to the surface and not at the published lower level of 4500 feet Mean Sea Level. my Flight Service Station briefer did not mention this. understand; I know this infraction is my error; I did not track my intended flight as I wanted or planned. and it will not ever happen again. POSITIONAL awareness is always priority. I teach my students this and yet failed to do it myself. by flying everyday; having received flight instructor of the YR awards; complacency has slapped me in the face. I've learned something today.
