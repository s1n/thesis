ACFT left feet lauderdale; Flight Level with full fuel both tanks (60 gals). departed on left fuel tank. burned for 1 hour and switched to right tank; which burned for 2 hours; 15 minutes. switched back to left tank for what should have been another 1 hour; 30 minutes. engine quit for lack of fuel in approximately 18 minutes. switched back to right tank and engine ran normally for 10 minutes. engine again quit from lack of fuel. switched back to left tank but engine never picked up. made landing on country road with no cars on road. aircraft rolled approximately 300'; striking a mailbox with right wing. this lifted wing and put aircraft on left main wheel and nose wheel. aircraft kept rolling and I was able to make about a 20 degree turn to the right; staying on the road. the right wing tip struck several fence posts at approximately 20 MPH. this turned the plane to the right; and it ended up in a ditch with the left wing driven into fence post. no injury occurred in this incident. I believed this was caused by a faulty fuel bladder in the left wing or by a fuel leak in flight. also after checking with an a & P mechanic it could have been caused by a restrict fuel vent on the left wing. aircraft burns 11.5 GPH with 56 usable gals; giving total time in flight 4 hours; 40 minutes. total time in flight was 3 hours; 54 minutes. this trip was made many times before in 3 hours; 45 minutes on 40 gals of fuel.
