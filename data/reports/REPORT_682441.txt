ABOUT 40 mile n of RBS VFR Omni-Directional Radio Range on CLBOUT; encountered a severe turbulence event climbing through 20.5K en route to 23K. flight attendants had been asked to 'stay down' and were at the time seated. SEATBELT sign was on and all passenger were seated. no injuries occurred. about 20 seconds in duration; with minimal g-loading; maybe +1.5 - 1.0. weather radar was on and painting a large area of 'green' with some yellow/red to Federal Aviation Regulation sides of scope (clear on either side of small green area in front of us). as we approached the green cells in front of us; a break occurred in the clouds and we saw a fairly large cell in front of us and an opening to the left (se). we informed Air Traffic Control of our deviation as we were turning. the event occurred after about 20 degree of turn away from the larger cell on our nose (we were on the western edge of the smaller cell; as we were going between the 2 'green' cells). control wheel was almost full right trying to stop the leftward rolling moment. required significant forward control to right the aircraft. report filed with dispatch and maintenance immediately. request sent to get aircraft mechanic to inspect aircraft.
