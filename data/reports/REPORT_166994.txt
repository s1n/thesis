AT cable airport for fly-in I called for weather in san diego and el cajon. an on shore flow put gillespie field below Visual Flight Rules minimums. another pilot told me he had called ramona and his wife said the sky was open. when I arrived it was solid overcast. we look for openings in overcast and did not find any. at that time we turned back to go to french valley airport which was Visual Flight Rules. half way back I became concerned that we would not have enough fuel if we ran into any problems; so we turned toward the coast and contacted palomar tower; told them our problem and they told Air Traffic Control who took over and brought us down over the water and vector us to palomar airport. our altitude was 600' Mean Sea Level when we broke out of the overcast. the airports lights were turned up and they blinked them to make sure we saw the runway. we made a low altitude approach to runway 6 and made a normal landing. when we refueled on sunday 1/91; we took on 22 gals of fuel. total fuel tank capacity was 27 gals. palomar tower and san diego approach control were extremely professional; concerned; calm and very quick to respond to my problem. I can't say enough to express my thanks to these very professional controllers. there attitude kept me calm and confident.
