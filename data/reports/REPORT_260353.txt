SIT: Instrument Meteorological Conditions. total electrical failure except gear landing light on only after down. therefore; loss of all communication and navigate. there was no indication of ammeter discharge. flew E to known Visual Flight Rules and descended below clouds. dead reckoning to airport. unable to determine exact position; but knew general vicinity. had backup electrical but that failed (too much power draw). exact positioning: due exactly where we were at failure; but had to guess position afterwards. difficulty in lowering landing gear by hand. critical to have sectionals as well as Instrument Flight Rules charts of area TRANSVERSED. cause of electrical still undetermined. retrospectively; I should have had HANDHELD to negate the failure of backup electrical since it seems the navigate/communication was at fault or short somewhere that COULDN't be isolated by closing off switches. I had no training for such occurrences; but have read extensively on Instrument Flight Rules procedures. I would suspect more training is placed on such procedures.
