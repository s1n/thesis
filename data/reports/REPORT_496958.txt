AFTER landing on runway 23 and exiting right onto taxiway E; we were instructed to taxi right onto taxiway Mach Number and hold short of taxiway B. we took the right turn on taxiway Mach Number; but continued past taxiway B failing to hold short. ground control advised us that we were to hold short of taxiway B for a dash 8 that had just landed on runway 23 and was about to turn off onto taxiway B. taxiway B was clear when we crossed it as the dash 8 was still rolling out on runway 23 prior to initiating his turnoff to taxiway B. we were nowhere close to a near miss. we were at the end of an 11 hour duty day. First Officer read back ground clearance instructions but Captain did not hear them. First Officer then got busy with after landing checklist and duties.
