ON takeoff roll the flap/slat warning went off. I aborted the takeoff and we discovered the flaps/slats had not been extended at all. we RECONFIGURED completed the checklist properly and took off for MSY. we both agreed that the challenge 'flaps and slats' on the mechanical checklist had not been announced. we were both quite sure that it WASN't a matter of paying lip service to the checklist. it is likely that the tab had been closed out accidentally. we both thought of doing a takeoff warning horn check as is our habit; but neither of us initiated it. there were no significant DISTRS. fatigue may have entered into the situation to some degree.
