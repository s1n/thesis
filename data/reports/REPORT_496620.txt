OVER prost; I commanded the Pilot Not Flying to select flaps 45 degree (AIRSPD was at 165 Knots Indicated Airspeed). the flaps extended from 30 degree; the previous flap setting; to 36 degree on the left and 37 degree on the right and stopped. a 'flaps fail' caution was displayed on our Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System. after following the procedures in our Quick Reference Handbook; the flaps were re-selected to 30 degree but there was no change in flap indicator. landing was made uneventfully. callback conversation with RPTR revealed the following information: the RPTR stated the direct cause of the flap split has not been RPTED by maintenance but it was believed to be the flap position indicator. the RPTR said the flaps were set at 20 degree and the airplane was maintenance ferried to a company maintenance facility.
