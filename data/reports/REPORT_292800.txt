I set the Auto-Pilot on and could not get the altitude hold button to work. I was then distracted by one of the passenger and as my head was turned around; the airplane climbed 300- 500 feet above my assigned altitude of 10000 feet. I immediately descended to 10000 feet and stayed there. the controller advised me of my deviation and I acknowledged him.
