WINDS at BRD were variable from 270 to 310 degree at about 15 Knots; favoring runway 23 for larger aircraft but runway 30 for light aircraft. we announced on Common Traffic Advisory Frequency/UNICOM (frequency 122.7) that we were taxiing for departure on runway 23; with no response from any traffic in the area. while on the ground short of runway 23; we received our Instrument Flight Rules clearance from MSP center. no traffic was observed; but we announced our intentions on Common Traffic Advisory Frequency/UNICOM (again with no response); then taxied onto runway 23 and departed. while on the takeoff roll we heard a radio query from a single engine SMA that had aborted his simultaneous takeoff on runway 30. we were already well above our V1 decision speed by that time; so we continued our departure. he had come to a stop about 1/4 mile short of the 12/30 and 05/23 runway intersection. we XED the runway intersection at about 100-200' above ground level. no evasive action was taken or required on our part. the end of runway 30 is obscured by trees and is not visible from the end of runway 23. the SMA pilot stated to UNICOM that he had made a departure announcement; but we never heard it. perhaps he made his announcement while I; as Pilot Not Flying; was talking on communication #2 with company (for weight and balance closeout) or with MSP center (for Instrument Flight Rules clearance). in either case; the Pilot Flying should have heard him on communication #1 (Common Traffic Advisory Frequency/UNICOM); which was continuously monitored. why the SMA pilot DIDN't say anything during the 15-20 secs it took us to taxi onto the runway and complete our checklist is unknown. factors which may have contributed to reduced vigilance on our part were: fatigue caused by the previous six legs of a ten leg day (8.0 hours flying; 13.4 hours on duty with no break for meals; etc); and previous ground delays which had put us behind schedule.
