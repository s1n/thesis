WE were cleared for approach at HUGUENAT VFR Omni-Directional Radio Range. at MANEE intersection went to 2400 feet; thinking we passed neely and Glideslope was out. started to shoot a localizer approach. at 2000 feet noticed we had not passed neely. so we climbed until passing neely; about 15 seconds and shot the approach. got a false Compass Locator At Its Outer Marker indication when Automatic Direction Finder needle swung when we thought we were at neely the first time. after further looking; that was probably orange county airport. factors also were night; icing; and snow. also; rushing and not allowing time to think before acting. decision to level off and climb was the right thing to do. new york approach also advised after we noticed and started to correct through stewart tower of low altitude alert. should have had kingston VFR Omni-Directional Radio Range tune into the Distance Measuring Equipment for Distance Measuring Equipment readouts.
