2 aircraft climbing NBOUND. aircraft #1 climbing to FL350. aircraft #2 climbing to FL280. aircraft #2 out-climbed aircraft #1 and vertical separation was lost. aircraft #2 should have been laddered up underneath aircraft #1 instead of climbing both to altitude and thinking #1 will out climb #2. supplemental information from ACN 356730: air carrier B747 and air carrier B737 both departed SFO and were in en route climb phase. right side recognized that horizontal and lateral separation was diminishing; but had vertical. he saw that vertical was 1100 feet and increasing and elected to let it alone. when rate of climb on top aircraft began to decrease; and vertical separation was decreasing; he was unable to take other action to ensure any other type of separation. he bet on rate of climb and did not ensure anything else.
