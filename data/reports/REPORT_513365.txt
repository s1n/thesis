LOCATION: JFK runway 13R. immediately after takeoff; I noticed a medium size sea gull in our flight path. I increased our climb slightly to pass over the bird. the gull passed just below the cockpit and I heard a thud -- sheet metal type sound -- directly below the fuselage. no damage was noted and we continued the flight. POSTFLT and maintenance inspection found no sign of the bird strike or damage.
