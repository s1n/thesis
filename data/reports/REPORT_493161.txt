I called UNICOM for traffic advisory and was told that there was one aircraft taking off for touch and go and one inbound from the E for runway 20. I radioed that I would be making a left 45 degree entry into the pattern. while I was on the left 45 degree line about 1/4 mile from downwind entry; the warrior (Y); took off and made a quick left turn to downwind. I slowed the RV4 to minimum AIRSPEED for downwind and followed the warrior. when I was at the point to turn OPS Base Operations Office (1/4 mile passed the numbers); the warrior was still on downwind. I called the warrior and asked if he was landing at danville. he said he was; so I said that I would go around because I DIDN't like to fly a 3-mile final. I turned crosswind;upwind;crosswind and then downwind calling all out over the radio. when on downwind; I saw the warrior sitting on the runway. I called OPS Base Operations Office; then final; then short final; but the warrior kept sitting on the active runway. so I called out that I would go around again. when I was on upwind the warrior started taking off and climbed out quickly. when the warrior reached my altitude; it came over to the right side of the runway and I had to turn to miss him. after I passed the warrior; I called that I was turning crosswind and turned crosswind then downwind. at this time the aircraft inbound from the E was on downwind. I radioed that I had him in sight and would try to land behind him. he landed and called clear of active then I landed. I told the warrior that he was not suppose to stop on the active runway with traffic in the pattern. he DIDN't say anything; but that he wanted my n number. I gave him my n number and asked who was flying the warrior. he would not answer me. callback conversation with the RPTR revealed the following information: RPTR indicated that training school aircraft often stop mid-runway during touch and go operations at dan in order to conduct instructor student discussion sessions.
