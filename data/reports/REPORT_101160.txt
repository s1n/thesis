THIS is just (another) comment on radio discipline. yes; controllers do talk too fast. we are using equipment older than most of today'S work force and it engages a lot slower than our brain(S). it'S hard; very hard; to wait after we key the microphone before we speak. with today'S hub system there are times when non stop talking ISN't enough to keep up. I'Mach Number reminded of the 'I love lucy' show where she (lucy) is working in the candy factory. as soon as she learns her job the conveyor belt speeds up faster and faster. well; I can't stuff aircraft in my pockets or down my shirt as lucy did the candy (much less Expected Approach Time them). so much for rapid fire CLRNCS. look how we; controller and pilot; are being 'helped' by the use of flight #'S. again; this is most troublesome during a hub push. an example ABC 1948; ABC 1958; ABC 1608; ABC 1938; plus others; will be on the frequency at the same time! those in the air and on the ground had better be on their toes! on top of that; the response I get most often to a clearance will be; 'roger.' now; 'who said that?!'; is my response. this could go on forever; but enough can't be said in favor of good radio discipline. it'S the only real tool we have to make this system work. I think we are stuck with the hub system. it'S good for the big boys on fifth avenue; but not so out here in the field. so; you folks in the air; use your full call sign; make sure you hear your call sign; and I'LL do my best to make sure that I'Mach Number heard and understood. let'S all make this a new year'S resolution we keep.
