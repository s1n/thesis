BE20 was issued a climb to 5000 feet on departure and was issued traffic SW of his position at 6000 feet. when the aircraft was climbing through 5700 feet I observed he had climbed above his assigned altitude. supplemental information from ACN 513443: BE1900 was on the GRANM four arrival at 6000 feet. I issued traffic 12 O'clock position; 6 mile; 4400 feet for 5000 feet. I noticed BE20 climbed above 5000 feet yelled to departure what was the king air doing. I issued traffic again to try to get visual separation. I turned BE1900 to a 090 degree heading to avoid traffic. the conflict alert did not alarm. the departing BE20 busted his assigned altitude of 5000 feet.
