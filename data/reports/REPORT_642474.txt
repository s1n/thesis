WHILE climbing through FL260 on a clear; smooth night; the aircraft yawed suddenly to the right with much buffeting and noise. a quick scan of the engine instruments showed that the right engine had failed while at climb power; EPR; N1; N2 and EGT were near 'zero' indications. the aircraft was leveled off; center was advised of the problem; and an emergency was declared. the abnormal procedure for engine failure was accomplished and we requested and received a clearance for a return to ZZZ; which was our departure airport. a visual single engine approach and landing was accomplished on runway 18R at ZZZ; and after an inspection by Crash Fire Rescue Equipment personnel; we taxied to the gate; whereupon the emergency was terminated.
