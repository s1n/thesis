ON taxi in; notified ground of B737 entry while awaiting ramp direction. as we approached; ramp cleared us into the taxiway. attempted numerous calls to ground to get clearance for taxiway but frequency was jammed as ground was trying to get an MD80 to move up to clear the way for a B757 to clear from runway. if the Captain stopped on taxiway he would have blocked all traffic. so; instead of waiting; he decided to continue on to clear the taxi flow. I was unaware; since I'Mach Number a new hire; that you needed both ramp and ground control clearance.
