AFTER leaving the deicing area at the ramp; flight left for taxiway D9. on taxiway D9 we were making a left turn on taxiway D. while the Captain began to make the turn; I was asked a question from the flight attendant. I turned back to answer her question; turned my head back to the front of the aircraft and realized the nose of the aircraft had left the taxiway. the Captain said that the NOSEWHEEL did not respond to the turn. we were taxiing extremely slow using only the #1 engine. engine was shut down; ground notified; and maintenance notified. maintenance arrived at the aircraft; inspected the aircraft and determined that the NOSEWHEEL had just departed the taxiway. no damage was evident to the NOSEWHEEL. maintenance told us to power back the aircraft. it was discussed in the cockpit. I checked my book and could not find a procedure and told the Captain. Captain and First Officer discussed it. both had PWRED back aircraft before. decided to power back the aircraft. all ENGS started; aircraft was PWRED back. we taxied back to the gate and wrote up the NOSEWHEEL in the aircraft forms. the aircraft was inspected; determined to be okay and the flight continued to FWA. things learned from this incident: should not have talked to flight attendant during taxi; even though I physically could not do anything to stop the aircraft from skidding. when I see that there is no procedure in the book; you don't think about doing it.
