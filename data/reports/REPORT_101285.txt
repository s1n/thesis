UPON gear extension one green gear down light failed to illuminate; gear was recycled and same occurred again; a go around was executed. crew completed required checklist procedures and returned for an uneventful landing; after gear was determined to be down and safe. Air Traffic Control was helpful in that they kept us informed of traffic and did not require extensive maneuvering from us; allowing crew to complete procedures more expeditiously and land sooner. my compliments to DFW terminal controllers. well done. aircraft remained on runway until gear was pinned. then taxied to gate. crash rescue was requested and were standing by; but not needed. the system worked well.
