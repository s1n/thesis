TULSA riverside (RVS) and tulsa international (TUL) airports have an Letter Of Agreement that all Instrument Flight Rules departures off runways 1L and 1R are to maintain 2500 feet Mean Sea Level and expect requested altitude 10 minutes after departure. additionally they are all given a 320 degree heading. 13 mile NW of RVS; there is an antenna with an Minimum Vector Altitude of 3100 feet Mean Sea Level for a 5 Nautical Mile radius. the 320 degree heading aims departures directly at the antenna. departures must be given an additional turn or climb prior to 8 mile out. even if the departure is only doing 100 Knots; it will be too close to that antenna before the 10 minute (No Radio) altitude restrict. today; an aircraft departed runway 1L on the above heading and altitude per the Letter Of Agreement. upon departing; the radar tag for the aircraft did not automatic acquire. a radar target appeared; but had a mode Celsius altitude indication of FL270. unable to positively identify the radar target as the aircraft. I issued the current altimeter and advised the pilot of the possible discrepancy. the pilot acknowledged that his mode Celsius was not correct. I called TUL to advise them of the aircraft'S position; altitude; and mode Celsius problem. the controller at TUL told me to 'stand by.' not having the authority/authorized to climb or turn the departure without permission from TUL; this allowed the aircraft to penetrate the 5 mile safety zone of the antenna. contributing factors: pilot departing with faulty transponder. poor procedure of aiming aircraft at a known obstacle at an altitude that is below the Minimum Vector Altitude. TUL controller should have immediately issued a turn or climb rather than a standby.
