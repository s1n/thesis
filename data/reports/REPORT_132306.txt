DUE to informal noise abatement procedures; the landing runway in use was 04. several aircraft (air carrier LGT and air carrier WDB) RPTED wind at 300' above ground as 230 degree at 25 and 38 Knots. 1 pilot even referred to the runway of arrival as dangerous. when the pilot RPTS were relayed to the supervisor in charge; he stated that W/O 50 operations per hour (the magic #); we would not be able to land on a runway more aligned with the wind; and would continue to land on runway 04. he did agree to land on runways 29R and left; however; the surface wind was 130 degree at 9 Knots (illegal to land on runway 29'S). it is my opinion that due to the wind; the only safe choice would have been to land on runways 11R and left. while I am all for noise abatement; I do believe safety should be the #2 priority. callback conversation with RPTR revealed the following: RPTR advised that he was the tower Controller In Charge controller; and that the information was passed on to him by the local controller. the supervisor was the area manager in the Terminal Radar Approach Control Facility. a noise sensitive community is located NW of the airport; and ARRS to runways 11 are discouraged. an informed noise abatement policy exists and specified that if 50 or more aircraft (arrival and departure) per hour; then runways most aligned with the wind are to be used. if there are less than 50; they will attempt to avoid landing aircraft on runways 11. a formal runway use program is being developed at this time by the airport managed. the pilot complaints were made by the aircraft on the ground after landing.
