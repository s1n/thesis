AFTER landing runway 33L in BWI; ground said taxi to the ramp. we parked at gate x. we taxied down taxiway P and we decided that taxiway E would be the best place to turn in for the gate. once we arrived; there was another aircraft at the gate; so we called operations. operations said follow the MARSHALER. we parked 2 aircraft at that gate. once we moved over slightly right; ground control said 'for future reference; you cannot taxi in that area.' later I called ground and asked 'should we be towed next time?' he said 'normally you take P1 for this gate.' none of this makes sense. there is a note that says 'don't taxi S of P1-Celsius' -- yet he told us this is normal. he acted like we were in the wrong. how do you get to this gate? I have done it the same way for 6 YRS. Air Traffic Control and the commercial airport page don't agree. plan of action: in the future at BWI; get exact taxi instructions. hopefully; the commercial airport page or Air Traffic Control will be corrected. how can you get to our gate when the note says 'do not taxi at the S end of pier Celsius?'
