FLT was all night red eye from cos-EWR. on final with gear extension all 4 anti-skid fail lights came on. approach missed to climb out of icing and holding entered to troubleshoot problem. due to snow at our alternate and good braking RPTED at EWR we elected to shoot another approach at EWR. during approach second check of circuit breaker panel discovered the parking brake control circuit breaker popped. resetting this circuit breaker corrected the problem. normal landing ensued. human factors: fatigue from all night flying with severe winter weather probably delayed discovery of popped circuit breaker. maintenance control in EWR was called on the radio during troubleshooting of problem. they never answered. their input would have been helpful.
