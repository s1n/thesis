INFORMED by my purser (#1 flight attendant) that flight attendant #5 had burnt his forearm/wrist in the forward galley; reaching for an entree; over #2. I interviewed the #5 flight attendant and then relieved him of his flight attendant duties and had him situation down for the rest of the flight. flight was non eventful.
