JUST after leveling off at FL370 after HVQ VFR Omni-Directional Radio Range; while reducing thrust; #2 engine let out a cannon-like explosion. I pulled the throttle back and did the failure checklist. weather excellent; plane was light; traffic was light; could almost see destination DCA. know that airport and emergency FACS; so elected to continue with 2 good ENGS and not land at HVQ airport since I know very little about it. my dispatcher and crew agreed. I send this in only because I know Federal Aviation Administration will try their best to say we did something wrong. everything turned out fine; with crash people standing by; etc.
