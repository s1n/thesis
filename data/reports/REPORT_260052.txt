WHILE taxiing for departure the nose gear collapsed. damage to propeller. callback conversation with RPTR revealed the following information: RPTR states aircraft is a cessna 210 which had a nose gear DOWNLOCK spring installed improperly at the factory. the DOWNLOCK spring has a 't' shape device which wraps around it and the 'ears' of the 't' were broken. this allowed the nose gear to be in a 'stuck' down position; but not locked down; as the spring did not engage. RPTR very upset as he is meticulous about maintenance and teaches flight safety for AOPA. asked if visible on PREFLT; RPTR stated no; it could never be seen. in addition; it would only be picked up on an annual if the mechanic was aware of the problem. he would need a flashlight and mirror to check the part. RPTR'S mechanic has been dealing with manufacturer; and apparently; the same problem has occurred on the cessna 172 RG and the cessna 182 RG. damage to aircraft was minimal as speed was slow.
