INGESTED ice on takeoff; after deicing in CVG. aircraft was covered with heavy coat of clear ice and about 1/4 inch of snow. I believe that while all the snow was removed; some clear ice remained after deice; and was not seen by deice crews. at rotation; the #1 engine surged and compressor stalled. after CLBOUT from the icing conditions; the aircraft was diverted to atlanta. #1 engine continued to surge and stall at higher power settings; but ran ok at reduced thrust. landing at ATL uneventful.
