I was returning to my home OPS Base Operations Office VNY after landing and turned off on the high speed taxiway. my right wheel went off the blacktop about 4 or 5 feet. my right wing hit an unlighted sign that is about 15 feet off the blacktop. I also knocked out the lamp and bulb on 1 green taxiway light. there is substantial damage to my right wing. callback conversation with RPTR revealed the following information: RPTR states the main problem was pilot behavior/fatigue. the flight had been very turbulent and it was concluding at night. while RPTR is familiar with the airport; he mistook the taxiway edge lights for the taxiway CTRLINE lights. this put him off center and was the reason for his taxiway excursion. the sign was the second problem as it was not lighted and he feels it is too high for low wing aircraft. the sign is lighted in the opposite direction. he spoke with Federal Aviation Administration personnel but has heard nothing further. he feels the airport management knows the sign should be lighted. they have said nothing to him nor sent him a bill for the repairs.
