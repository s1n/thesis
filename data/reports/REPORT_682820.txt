I issued aircraft Y an approach clearance. when he did not read it back; I sought confirmation of the clearance from the pilot. he acknowledged the clearance but never began the descent. I took evasive action with aircraft x to maintain separation. upon reviewing the tapes; it became apparent that aircraft Y never read back the descent portion of the clearance.
