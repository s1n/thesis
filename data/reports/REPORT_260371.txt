TAXIING from the ramp at LAF at night. made a wrong turn and crossed runway 10/28; the active at the time. there was no sign to indicate which runway I was crossing. I cleared both directions before crossing. we were the only aircraft on the field at the time. no mention on the Automatic Terminal Information Service of signs being out or construction on the ramp area. the controller DIDN't question us; it was I who brought the situation up after I had crossed the active runway. commuter operations of 3 days of heavy flying; reduced rest; no runway signs and busy doing last minute commuter paper work changes; all contributed to the runway incursion. 12 hour day 6 hour flight time.
