AS I am a recent pilot (I received my private pilot certificate on FEB/XA/01); I make it a point to train regularly on my aircraft (a lake amphibian renegade 250). on jun/XA/01; I gave myself some WATERWORK; steep turns; rough and glassy water LNDGS; as well as air work; slow turns; steep turns; stalls. after this work; I proceeded to SHECHRADER airport for refueling. this is a class E UNCTLED airport. I proceeded to enter the pattern downwind and CLRLY announced my intentions. 2 aircraft were in proximity. one had just taken off and another was back-taxiing runway 14. I proceeded to go through my checklist on downwind. when I arrived abeam the numbers; I interrupted my checklist to determine if I should extend my downwind for the back-taxiing act. I then continued my checklist inadvertently skipping over the landing gear section. I landed with the gear up. minimal damage was sustained by the aircraft and the runway was cleared 1 hour later after the airplane'S landing gear was extended using jacks. I should have visually checked the gear twice as I was instructed this would have alleviated the incident.
