AT FL350 .75 mach the CAPTS window (left-1) shattered (outer pane). we declared an emergency; slowed the aircraft and descended to FL180 at 250 Knots Indicated Airspeed. all checklist were accomplished and the flight was terminated at denver uneventfully. callback conversation with RPTR revealed the following information. RPTR stated he had never seen this happen before. he looked toward the Captain and saw a bubbling of the film layer between panes of window. as he and Captain watched bubbling increased all across the window; a crack appeared in upper left and moved across the window. suddenly the whole outer pane shattered with a terrible noise. it did not separate from the aircraft.
