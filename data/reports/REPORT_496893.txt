GND crew opened cargo door early. I really don't want to send this; but in the interest of safety I must. while taxiing in last night; about 50 feet away from parking; several caution lights in the cockpit went off. what had happened was that one of the ground crew had opened the forward cargo door way too early. due to the momentum of the aircraft and the overall traffic situation; I continued to taxi until we stopped at the gate. while not trying to get anyone in trouble; we simply cannot have this. while the caution lights in the cockpit are a major distraction to us at a critical time; I feel that this is much more dangerous to the guy(S) on the ground. a 250;000 pound airplane taxiing at 2-3 Knots creates a lot of momentum. opening a large cargo door while the plane is still moving is simply not safe for anyone on the ground.
