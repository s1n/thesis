IMMEDIATELY after liftoff KWK tower instructed us to turn right (WBOUND) and proceed 'on course; contact CVG approach control.' immediately contacted CVG approach to be told that we were entering the class B airspace without prior clearance. this is the sort of clearance confusion that causes accidents in airspace transition areas. when one Air Traffic Control facility issues instructions to an aircraft; it should be assumed that those instructions have been coordinated and approved by the next Air Traffic Control facility; especially in very close airspace transition areas! you can't wander all over the area awaiting approval at 140 Knots; and you obviously can't stop. it is assumed that whenever cleared you will have sufficient time to clean up the aircraft and contact departure without becoming an unwanted imposition on your next Air Traffic Control sector. please work to improve this type of Visual Flight Rules handoff/coordination.
