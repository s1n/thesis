ON approach to runway 31 at LNS; I had difficulty seeing the airport. I suddenly spotted the airport and was still in a position to land but needed to descend quickly. as I was about to lower the landing gear; the tower called and commanded a go around because of gear being up. I did go around and came back in for uneventful landing.
