PROB arose because of confusion on taxiway. arrived at Fixed-Base Operator; multiple aircraft; no place to park; multiple marks and lines at customs next to Fixed-Base Operator. taxied into a position where the only way to exit was to back aircraft into parking spot. because of multiple lines and congestion I thought I was on Fixed-Base Operator ramp. got out of aircraft to push it out of way. discovered I was still on taxiway when approached by airport security. contributing factors: 1) multiple areas; lines; etc at ramp; taxiway and customs all converge at this area. 2) extreme congestion; aircraft parked all over. 3) I exited aircraft to move it out of the way and try to relieve congestion thinking I was on ramp. 4) airport security tells me this has happened several times before in this same area. corrective actions: 1) better markings(?) 2) if I would have realized I was on taxiway I would have contacted ground control prior to exiting.
