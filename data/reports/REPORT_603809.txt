AFTER takeoff from runway 31L at JFK; inertial reference #1 and inertial reference #3 faulted (2 of our 3 inertial reference units). both AUTOPLTS and AUTOTHRUST were inoperative and Captain'S attitude and navigate display blanked. inertial reference #2 and First Officer'S instruments were normal. we leveled at 5000 feet; conferred with maintenance control and attempted troubleshooting without success. we then returned to JFK for an OVERWT landing on runway 31R. touchdown was smooth and braking normal. the manufacturer will tell you that the odds of such a dual failure are so low that it cannot happen. I am here to tell you I can happen. after the units were RERACKED and tested; we departed again and again inertial reference #3 faulted. however; the other 2 were normal and we were able to continue.
