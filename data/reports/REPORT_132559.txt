I cleared ATX x to cross 20 W FTZ at 8000. some minutes later I cleared ATX x to descend and maintain 9000. according to the tape the pilot read back; 'roger; descend right on down to 9000 and cross 20 out at 8'. all I heard on the READBACK was descend to 9000. callback conversation with reporter revealed the following: reporter was vectoring ATX x for spacing behind air carrier Y. he had issued a clearance to ATX x to descend to cross 20 W FTZ at and maintain 8000. he then instructed ATX x to descend and maintain 9000. reporter observed ATX x leaving 8700; conflict alert activated; and he instructed ATX x to climb back to 9000.
