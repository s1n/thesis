TODAY; 1/89; I was saved from an embarrassing incident by the helpful controller at arrival. I was approaching the airfield from the se and was cleared to land on runway 27 and to enter and report a left OPS Base Operations Office. I had it in my mind that I would be landing on runway 9. from my position; landing on runway 9 would be either a right downwind entry or a right OPS Base Operations Office entry and I noted this to the controller and I was once again cleared to land. when it became obvious to the controller that I was entering the downwind for runway 9; he mentioned that fact and I finally realized my error. 5 YRS ago I would not have given this incident a second thought. however; with all of the publicity about Federal Aviation Administration enforcement; any kind of incident makes me uneasy. my perception of how the Air Traffic Control system should work is for it to be a team effort between the pilots and the controllers. it scares me in that at this point in time; it appears that more of an adversarial relationship is starting to develop; instead of a team effort. this can't be good for either group or for the millions who travel by air every year. a lot has been written in aviation related magazines lately about this topic. the point of view is usually from the cockpit. I would be interested in the attitudes and perceptions of the controllers.
