DURING CLBOUT after departing lax; part of the right wing (leading edge between the engine and the fuselage) was found to be torn/missing. a subsequent uneventful return to lax was made. emergency equipment was standing by upon landing and dismissed by the Captain after ascertaining the emergency equipment was not needed. I do not know what caused part of the right leading edge to break and I do not know when the breakage happened. callback conversation with RPTR revealed the following information: the RPTR stated that nothing actually departed the aircraft. this information came from a passenger who related it to a flight attendant. the RPTR said the #6 slat was visually checked extended and retracted and the area just behind the leading edge was separating. the RPTR stated on landing the airplane had a slight vibration at flaps 1 degree and it was decided not to extend the slats fully. the RPTR said the airplane was taken Out Of Service and no information was available from maintenance. supplemental information from ACN 390147: at approximately 12000 feet Mean Sea Level the senior flight attendant advised me that a passenger observed part of the right wing had separated from the aircraft. my First Officer went back to the cabin and checked the right wing. he RPTED to me that aircraft skin was missing behind slat #6. my First Officer contacted flight control and they agreed we should return to lax. I slowed the aircraft to 200 Knots and extended flaps to 1 degree. at that time we detected a small amount of vibration but no control problems. we landed on runway 25R at lax with no further problems.
