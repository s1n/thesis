THE event happened after we were cleared to descend via the chins 5 arrival into sea. the arrival has a restrict of 280 Knots at 16000 feet at RADDY. Air Traffic Control asked our indicated AIRSPEED approximately 15 Nautical Mile prior to RADDY. I responded and noted that we were about 250 Knots Indicated Airspeed and asked what speed they needed. they directed us to comply with the 280 Knots Indicated Airspeed restrict at RADDY. we increased AIRSPD to 280 degree and continued the arrival; approach and landing. once on the ground; tower advised us to call ZSE area supervisor. our discussion afterwards CTRED on the fact that our new lower cost index 15 in the B737NG descends at 256 Knots Indicated Airspeed which is slower than the arrival requires. even though both pilots reviewed and verified the speed and altitude RESTRS on the arrival and in the aircraft database; the aircraft slowed in Vertical Navigation to match the lower cost index 15 speed.
