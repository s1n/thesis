ATIS RPTED winds 210 degree at 7 Knots with a 3700 feet overcast. approach requested 180 Knots to the marker and the crew complied. upon Glideslope intercept; it took approximately 15-20 degree of correction to maintain the localizer. the tower immediately notified of WINDSHEAR advisories upon check-in with surface winds 300 degree at 15 Knots gusting to 30 Knots. the crew was barely able to meet stabilized approach criteria. I felt that Air Traffic Control (approach control) was asking too much of this crew and the crew probably should have taken the initiative to say 'unable' to the speed request.
