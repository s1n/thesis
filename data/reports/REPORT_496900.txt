WHILE being vectored for the Instrument Landing System runway 36L into CVG; Air Traffic Control asked if we had the runway in sight. we responded 'yes' and were then cleared for the visual runway 36L. later; Air Traffic Control asked what our speed was and we responded 145 Knots. they said we were told to maintain 180 Knots till final. however; my First Officer and myself do not recall that part of the clearance.
