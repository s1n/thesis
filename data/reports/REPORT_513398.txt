CTLR restrict us to 180 Knots to 5 Nautical Mile final. this puts the aircraft 50 Knots above approach speed just before starting down at BIRDD on a steeper than normal glide path. we started slowing early in order to achieve approach speed before descent on final. controller asked us about our speed vice the clearance. we should have informed him earlier about our slowdown. however; believe the clearance was not in the best interest of a safe approach in accordance with company guidelines.
