WHILE on the ground at day S I received my instrument clearance from day departure via radio/land line communications. I read the clearance back and was told READBACK correct. the controller then proceeded to talk to someone else. there were no departure restrictions in the clearance. approximately 1 minute later I departed. another minute later I contacted day departure and the controller asked 'who released you?' from this question I assume the controller was not expecting me to depart but was expecting me to hold for release. paragraph 323 of the Aeronautical Information Manual states that a controller may assign departure restrictions when necessary. in this instance no departure restrictions were given. paragraph 270 of the Aeronautical Information Manual states; 'when Air Traffic Control issues a clearance or instruction pilots are expected to execute its provisions upon receipt.' I had my clearance with no departure restrictions so I executed my clearance and departed. at this point I don't feel that I have done anything in violation of the Federal Aviation Regulation'S or Aeronautical Information Manual. however; there was a pilot/controller communication problem. I feel that the Aeronautical Information Manual should be amended to require a radar release; active/void time; release time; or the statement 'contact departure on (frequency) when airborne' when departing an uncontrolled field on an instrument flight plan. this should help enforce pilot/controller XCHKING during communications. from now on I will always check first.
