APPROX 300 feet after takeoff; we got a tail compartment high temperature light and a master warning light. the Captain continued the CLBOUT while I performed the red box. after approximately 1 minute; the light extinguished. we told Air Traffic Control we needed an immediate return and were cleared a right downwind and to 3000 feet. while executing the checklist we climbed to 3400 feet then corrected down. Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System II showed no traffic. we returned for an OVERWT landing. although we did not declare an emergency; the tower controller was referring to us as one on the radio so we thought that was sufficient. we landed and taxied to the gate uneventfully. callback conversation with RPTR revealed the following information: the First Officer RPTR stated that after the POSTFLT inspection that maintenance had found a loose connection; '...somewhere back in the tail....' he had heard the part name but could not recall the exact definition of it at this time. it was part of the high pressure air bleed system that supplies hot air for the tail anti-icing system. he further stated that the airline operations department had put out an operational bulletin to the Flight Crew'S about the noted increase in tail compartment high temperature indications that have resulted in a return land after a departure from a primary airport.
