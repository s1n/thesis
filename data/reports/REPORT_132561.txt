ALLENTOWN; Public Address approach control working air carrier x from PHL to HPN. controller gave turn direct STW VFR Omni-Directional Radio Range. just as turn was started; controller called traffic 'SMT Y at 12 O'clock; opposite direction 5200' descending.' I looked up and there he was. we both evaded right. asked controller if he was working the SMT. confirmed he was. no explanation asked for--none offered.
