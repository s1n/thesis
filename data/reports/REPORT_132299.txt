WE had just departed DCA in an MLG. after following the NE noise abatement procedures and several vectors; we were directed Area Navigation direct daily intersection on course. after passing daily we noted that the Flight Management System was tuning only 2 stations instead of the usual 4 or 5. the Flight Management System then went into dead-reckoning. we pulled out our maps and started tuning the VFR Omni-Directional Radio Range'S and correcting the course. Flight Management System had been indicating about a 70 Knot crosswind; when in fact we had 140 Knots. center advised we were 8 mile left of course and vectored us for correction. we advised them of our situation and later RPTED the Area Navigation capability inoperative. we could prevent such an incident if we backed up the Flight Management System with manual systems; however; that would defeat the whole concept of 2-Mach Number crews with high-tech computers assuming part of the workload. on a flight such as this; the only thing computers do for pilots is double the workload.
