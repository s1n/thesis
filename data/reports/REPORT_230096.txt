ACR x; an MLG; departed SRQ climbing to 10000 Mean Sea Level. I observed the mode Celsius of this aircraft go from 3000 to 6200 for a period of 2 sweeps of my radar and then return to 3200 and resumed normal readout. this is a serious safety problem that TPA approach has been experiencing for Federal Aviation Regulation too longitude. it must be corrected before something bad happens.
