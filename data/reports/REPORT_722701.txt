WHEN the gear did not retract after takeoff; it showed left main down; right main up/gear in transit. we lowered gear after consultation of checklist and landed safely in MGW. after consultation with maintenance; we departed for CLE and encountered the same problem. we decided to return to MGW and have maintenance inspect the aircraft. after a safe landing; maintenance discovered that the main gear was also secured with unmarked/UNFLAGGED pins. supplemental information from ACN 722704: the First Officer proceeded to do a detailed WALKAROUND of the aircraft. on his WALKAROUND he proceeded to remove the only gear pin that we knew was installed on the aircraft; the NOSEWHEEL gear pin. what we did not know was that the left and right main gear had also been pinned; much less without streamers or flags affixed to the pins. contributing factors: 1) mechanic'S failure to recognize that the cockpit indications meant what they did. 2) maintenance failure to place back streamers on aircraft gear pins.
