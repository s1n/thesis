NEAR miss. my Celsius-402 almost ran over Celsius-207 on a flight back from grand canyon airport to las. it was 20 minutes before sunset. my training pilot and I could not see into the setting sun 11 to 12 O'clock. I called on the radio to the Celsius-207 for his position. both the Celsius-207 and the Celsius-402 had 1 VFR Omni-Directional Radio Range to use and visual CHKPOINTS. the visual CHKPOINTS were not much help because countryside looks the same. we saw the Celsius-207 1130 to 12 O'clock ahead and pulled up. we flew over it about 100 to 150 feet. I am going to get a better pair of sunglasses for the sun glare.
