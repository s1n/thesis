AFTER completing normal PWRBACK and facing W; ground control cleared us to reverse course and taxi E to takeoff on runway 9. I cleared the zone to my right for a right turn reversal. at a n heading in the turn; an aircraft on taxiway NB was taxiing with all landing; taxi lights on; partially blinding me. when that aircraft turned off his lights; I immediately saw grass underneath us and called out 'we're in the grass!' we stopped and notified ground control and the company. at no time did I note any lights delineating ramp from grass in our course reversal. suggest lighting the demarcation of grass and ramp to avoid this type incident in the future. no injuries or damage occurred.
