I was cleared for a visual approach to runway 15 ASE. however; wind favored runway 33. the aircraft landing before me was asked to remain E of CTRLINE runway 15/33. I was told to follow that aircraft. I entered a circle approach to runway 33 (I was single pilot). I was concerned about an aircraft that was overflying airport (C172). my performance/judgement was more concerned looking outside and not in checking which runway was the active. in fact; the tower asked me 2 times (twice) my intentions. I stated I was landing runway 15; when in fact the runway I was circling to was runway 33. had I looked at the approach plate; or even the airport diagram; I would have known I was going the wrong way. it was not until I started a circle OPS Base Operations Office that I discovered my error. I just entered left downwind and landed. this was an event that caused me problems; but it shows a lack of judgement and overconfidence when landing at the same airport many times.
