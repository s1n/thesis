AFTER landing on runway 3 at ABQ; I exited the runway at taxiway Celsius. taxiway Celsius is set up as a high speed taxiway exit from runway 3; so my taxi speed was probably 30 Knots and decreasing as I taxied n on taxiway Celsius. momentarily; my attention was diverted to 2 F16'S making low approaches; gars; on runway 8. as I refocused on taxiway Celsius; I realized I was rapidly approaching runway 30/12 and HADN't received clearance to cross. I brought the aircraft to a stop; but not before I had crossed the hold short line. within seconds after I had stopped; ABQ tower told us to contact ground. when we switched to ground control; we RPTED clear of runway 3. ground control cleared us to cross runway 12 and told us to hold short of runway 8. in my opinion; the contributing factors were: a mind set of a quick taxi to our gate in an attempt to get back on schedule; the fact that this was the first time I had flown with this First Officer and I was not familiar with how he managed radio communication and how tentative he might be with regard to asking for a frequency change or clearance to continue taxiing; and finally the fact that the tower controller was trying to manage 2 different runways and the operations of at least 5 different aircraft simultaneously (2 F16'S on low approach; 2 holding short awaiting departure on runway 8; and 1 aircraft clearing runway 3 (our aircraft). solutions: first and foremost; a re-emphasis on stopping when clearing an active runway; second; keeping the pace of events slower during the first couple of FLTS with an unfamiliar crew member; and finally; with this location; the installation of wigwag lights may help remind pilots of the presence of a runway along this taxi route.
