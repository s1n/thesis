I was participating in a hot air balloon event at durant; ok; on jun/sat/01. upon landing after completion of a competitive task at approximately XA30 hours; I observed a cow running in a pasture where another balloon had landed a short distance from me. an individual who was not part of the balloon crew was chasing the cow. (I believe he was a neighbor of the property owner.) the cow ultimately attempted to jump a barbed wire fence and was caught by 1 feet. the cow; very quickly; got loose from the fence and ran to the back of the pasture out of my sight. my balloon chase crew was authority/authorized by the property owner (who was out of town) to enter the property and retrieve my passenger; my balloon and myself. the other balloon crew was also given permission to enter the property for the purpose of retrieving their balloon; pilot and passenger. upon arrival at my landing site; the property owner was informed of the incident and proceeded into the pasture to investigate any injury/damage done to the livestock. when he returned to our location; he advised that the cow had 'a small scratch on 1 shoulder and 1 foot' and was a bit shaken but was otherwise not seriously injured.
