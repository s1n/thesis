WHILE on a vector by approach control; approaching reno from NW; aircraft entered severe turbulence. AIRSPD fluctuations were +/-20 Knots and ALTDEVS were +/-300 feet. I decided to climb; when the Ground Proximity Warning System announced 'terrain;' but no 'whoop; whoop; pull up' was announced; I advanced power and climbed to 10000 feet while announcing to approach that we were climbing to 10000 feet and had encountered a terrain warning and severe turbulence. there is nothing I would have done differently.
