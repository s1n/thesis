TKOF lax landing gear would not retract; gear handle would not go past mid position and gear would not retract. performed abnormal checklist and no help. returned to lax and landed overweight. performed OVERWT checklist. also had a buffet at speed above 220 Knots. kept speed below 210 Knots. returned for landing. no further problem! callback conversation with RPTR revealed the following: problem was caused by double failure of both the primary and backup channel in electronic lock box that is in the circuit to prevent gear handle retraction if it senses something wrong. could not determine what caused buffet. as cabin attendant felt it at their seats which are about over nose gear; suspect it was something to do with nose gear; possibly gear door partly open; but all appeared normal when back on ground.
