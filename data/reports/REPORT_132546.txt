A mental lapse caused the problem. I violated airspace at a sector that I had worked approximately 1 hour before. the conflict alert discovered the CONFLICTION. callback conversation with reporter revealed the following: reporter advised that both aircraft were ACRS. the aircraft he was working had been issued a descent into the next controller'S airspace. he was then relieved from the sector for a break and forgot to brief the new controller that a HANDOFF had not been made. he learned of the conflict when he returned from his break. he did not know why the next controller did not take action to separate the aircraft when conflict alert activated; but suspects that there was not much time to prevent a loss of separation. reporter states that incident occurred at FL310 with aircraft at 1600' and 4.6 mile apart.
