SMT x on Instrument Flight Rules flight plan cleared to MDSD via; 'radar vectors g-3 mella g-3 MDSD.' aircraft departed and the departure controller issued; 'proceed direction BQN on course.' BQN was not on the aircraft route of flight. I; as the center controller; took the HANDOFF but due to our FDRS problem I did not have the flight strip and by the coordination with the departure controller I knew that the aircraft was going BQN on course. I assigned the aircraft FL220 and went to take care of other aircraft that needed my attention. the aircraft was W of BQN going toward mella level at FL220. I looked at the bay; and his strip was there coordinated at FL220. I terminated radar service with the aircraft; switched aircraft to MDSD about 20 mile inside SJU airspace. a few minutes later MDSD called saying that the aircraft had not shown up at mella but 15 mile to the n. these I believe were contributing factors: the aircraft originally filed SJU B520 BQN B520 MDSD. clearance delivery changed his route to g-3 mella g-3 MDSD. departure controller gave aircraft; 'direction BQN on course.' BQN was not on his clearance. I; as center controller did not have a flight strip on aircraft because our FDRS system has not been printing strips correctly for the last 3 weeks. this means the D controller has to request every strip he needs manually and has to wait for that strip to be finished printing before he can request another. the pilot assumed that after BQN he was to go direction MDSD even though his clearance did not have BQN on it.
