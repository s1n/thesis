CALLED ground for taxi for departure. was cleared from E ramp to runway 23R via runway 27R. crossed runway 23L on runway 27L and hold short of runway 23R. ground control then asked what runway I was cleared to taxi to. I verified runway 23R; but they seemed confused as to which runway I was cleared to.
