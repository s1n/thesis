WHILE en route from HPN-mia at FL390; my First Officer was flying the aircraft. we were cleared direct to ISO; which was on our flight plan. after ISO; we were supposed to join an airway. my First Officer selected the navigate mode on the Auto-Pilot to go direct ISO. when we got to the VOR and TACAN (Co-Located); the Global Navigation System (our navigate source) did not AUTOSEQUENCE to the next fix on the airway. my First Officer did not notice the failure and we were flying merely a heading for 6 or 7 minutes. Air Traffic Control queried the situation and said we were way off course. they then cleared us direct to OMN VOR and TACAN (Co-Located). no incidents had occurred.
