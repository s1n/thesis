AFTER landing; as the Captain was turning from runway to taxiway; the tower gave instructions to taxi to hold short of runway 30L; then added; TXWYS RPTED slippery. almost immediately the aircraft started sliding to the right coming to rest with both right main tires off the taxiway. the aircraft was secured and passenger were deplaned with people movers. the tower'S remark was the first indication that the TXWYS were slick. Automatic Terminal Information Service did not have a notice; and NOTAMS had a reference to runways being deiced but; also neglected to mention the TXWYS; the speed on exit was normal for a dry or wet runway. unfortunately; the hazard was not brought to this crew'S attention until too late. as we sat in the aircraft waiting for maintenance help and the people movers; a liberal coat of sand was applied to the taxiway.
