AT approximately XA30; just W of rapid city VFR Omni-Directional Radio Range; a passenger went into convulsions. 2 doctors and a nurse took control of the problem for us. after a period of time; the doctors stated that she needed hospitalization as soon as possible. deviated to lincoln. on descent; one of the doctors came forward stating that they would need certain medications upon arrival in order to stabilize her; and that these medications are not normally carried in emergency vehicles. I elected to have him come into the cockpit and use the radio himself; in order that there would be no mistakes made in what was needed. by the time he was satisfied; we were on short final and it was safer to have him remain in the cockpit rather than return to the cabin.
