TAXIED off runway 05 onto taxiway B5. we were cleared to the ramp. I ask controller if we're cleared all the way in onto taxiway R3 which joined taxiway B5. he said cleared to the ramp or parking. we stopped on taxiway R3 after we saw no taxi signs and asked again and he said this time he DIDN't control the ramp. so we continued on in using caution because 2 other parked airplanes were close. our 10T page after parking said it was a no taxi area for MLG'S. have controllers explain that taxiway R3 is a no taxi area. no mishap or close call just a little confusion.
