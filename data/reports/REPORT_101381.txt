A new san diego noise regulation prohibits operation of a stage ii (LGT or MLG) aircraft after XB00 local. violators are subject to a fine. our scheduled departure time to lax was XA45. weather conditions in southern CA dictated flow restrictions past XB00. to avoid cancelling the flight; I contacted my dispatcher who also contacted Federal Aviation Administration central flow control in washington. the plan was; if we were unable to obtain a release by XB00; we would re-file to las and attempt to change destination en route. we added enough fuel for a san-las flight with PHX as an alternate and departed at XB00 filed san-las. en route center controllers were quite helpful with the destination change. I informed Air Traffic Control that I had plenty of holding fuel; and any position in the arrival stream was fine with me. upon arrival in lax; my dispatcher informed me that lax Air Route Traffic Control Center planned to violate us. subsequent communication between my company; Federal Aviation Administration central flow control and lax Air Route Traffic Control Center resulted in a verbal agreement not to file the violation. these thoughts and/or questions come to mind: we were unable to depart on any routing to lax; or to a lax holding fix; why? if Federal Aviation Administration central flow control had no problem with our plan; why did a lax Air Route Traffic Control Center supervisor want to file a violation? (communications problem?) I believe my crew and I did our passenger and company a service by operating our flight safely and by not violating local noise regulations; and (we firmly believe) Federal Aviation Regulation'S. the potential safety problem of rushed CHKLISTS and having to deal with this superfluous garbage to try to operate a flight could cause an accident.
