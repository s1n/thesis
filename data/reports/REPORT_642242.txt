AFTER landing at XYZ hospital in ZZZ for a patient transport; I was notified by the lead mechanic via cell phone that we had overflown a component on the #1 engine and the helicopter was Out Of Service for maintenance. I notified nursing staff and coordination the second aircraft to transport the patient. the component; the #1 engine flow fence actuator; had been overflown by over 60 hours. contributing factors for this incident include: 1) failure of the pilots and MECHS to verify the total time for the total engine time versus the component change time. 2) failure of the company to provide timely maintenance status records. 3) assumptions that the most current and timely components are tracked by the company records section and contract sites will be notified if a component is due to be changed. 4) assumption by the pilots that the MECHS are keeping track of all component change times and vice VERSA. 5) a recent change of the company record keeping policies. callback conversation with RPTR revealed the following information: the cause of the overfly is the flight crew'S and technician'S failure to monitor engine total time and check with component change time. the function of the flow fence is control and limit the air and fuel feed to the engine.
