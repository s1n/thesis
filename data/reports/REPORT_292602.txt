I am enclosing articles about an on-going situation at XYZ airlines; and possibly at others; that is a 'safety' issue. they are using cockpit resource management to have your crews spy on their fellow pilot; and report to the chief pilot or someone else in management. this has created an atmosphere of tension; and mistrust in the 'office.' many CAPTS feel that you have to be politically correct or DR sigmund frog or you will be turned in by your crew. it has happened numerous times with the result of some pilots being terminated: forced out on disability: or given time off. grievances are filed and months; YRS; wasted out of a career not to mention the stress; anxiety; and tension caused in the pilots home. cockpit resource management was needed; but it is being abused by some to CIRCUMNAV the contract(S) and get rid of anyone who thinks or has an O2PINION. it is 'funny' that so many of these cased are senior pilots who have a large PAYCHK and pension coming!?! some sort of article should be written in callback to let everyone know what is going on and that it can happen to them next if they fall out of disfavor with their fellow pilots who are now in management! a crew needs to be relaxed; themselves; and work together to provide a safe working environment!
