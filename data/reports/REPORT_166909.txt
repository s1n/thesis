OUR clearance was a tight but MAKEABLE crossing NE of ELW. we were told to continue our DSNT to 2500' and call the field in sight. upon breaking out of the clouds we were on an offset final to a similar direction runway and called the field in sight. with clearance for a visibility approach we continued to descend for landing. shortly thereafter GSP approach advised we must have the wrong airport. they vectored us on the approximately same heading and 15 mile to GSP.
