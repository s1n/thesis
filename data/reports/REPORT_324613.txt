THIS bird strike occurred in an area known for bird activity; the NAPALI coast; island of kauai; hi. this area is a primary sight-seeing area for tourists who view the NAPALI by air; sea; and hiking trails. the birds who inhabit the NAPALI are high flying birds found at altitudes above 1000 feet above ground level. since the implementation of SFAR 71; helicopter FLTS are forced into airspace occupied by not only other aircraft; but the majority of bird life which inhabits the HAWAIIAN islands. prior to SFAR 71; pilots could select altitudes which best minimized or eliminated potential conflicts with other aircraft; wildlife; and prevailing weather. the SFAR 71; as written; does not adequately consider factors relevant to pilot and passenger safety. the bird struck the nose of the helicopter and deflected into the front windshield; passenger side breaking out an area of plexiglass of approximately 8 inches by 12 inches. the glass entered the cockpit and cabin but did not inflict any injury or further damage. the aircraft sustained no damage other than the windshield; and the flight was continued to OPS Base Operations Office for repairs. the final leg of the flight was conducted below 1000 feet above ground level to avoid further conflict with birds and other air tour aircraft.
