ON the Fixed-Base Operator ramp ready to taxi to active runway. ground cleared our aircraft S on taxiway right to runway 8R. we taxied S on taxiway right about 200 yards and held short runway 8R. switched to tower and we were cleared right turn -- cleared for takeoff runway 8R. I MISINTERPED the tower instructions 'cleared for right turn' as meaning cleared right turn on runway 8R. what he said was cleared for right turn after departure; cleared for takeoff runway 8R; which would be a left turn onto the runway. on the rolling takeoff myself and the tower realized I was heading the wrong direction on runway 8R. tower cleared my aircraft for a 180 degree turn on runway 8R for positioning for takeoff. once again we were cleared for takeoff runway 8R. no further problems during the flight.
