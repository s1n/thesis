WHILE working the final position at TPA I noticed two erroneous mode Celsius readouts. the first one was on air carrier x on the TPA 002/7.69. I observed the mode Celsius to be 999 for 1 sweep and then the aircraft went into Central Standard Time for 1 sweep. the aircraft was in a descent when this occurred. this aircraft was around 3000 feet descending when this occurred. the second occurrence was with air carrier Y on the TPA 018/15.19 descending through 6000 feet. this aircraft was observed to be in a Central Standard Time status for 2 sweeps.
