ON sunday; aircraft x (G200) was cleared onto runway 9; position and hold. I acknowledged and Captain (MR x) moved the aircraft into position. as the previous aircraft cleared the runway from back-taxi; tower/departure 'cleared for takeoff; turn on course.' I acknowledged; we were both in terrain mode for Ground Proximity Warning System on 10 mile scale. we talked about the mountain and towers straight ahead. we initiated takeoff and I thought the clearance negated the note in the takeoff section of commercial chart which stated; 'right-hand turn mandatory; hazard beacons on hills to E; must be visible.' conditions were clear/Visual Meteorological Conditions; visibility 10+ mile; temperature 27 degree; altimeter 30.03. we could both see the hills and towers. on takeoff; I told Captain the closest turn would be left for on course (approximately 140 degree versus 220 degree to right). at no time were we any nearer the hills in the left turn than if we would have turned right. after approximately 90 degree of turn; the controller said we 'were in a heap of trouble and we better say our best prayers.' I ask why and he replied; 'all turns are to the right.'
