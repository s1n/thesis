ON this day; I was working arrival radar with 2 sectors combined. traffic was heavy due to a holiday WKEND and we had been busy all day. I had worked several OVERFLTS and had handed them off to the next sector. as aircraft left my airspace; I no longer watched the data tags. I had forgotten about a single engine aircraft Y NBOUND at 9000 feet handing off but still in my airspace. I descended an air carrier on the arrival to 9000 feet. I then started to give a relief briefing to the next controller. I did not include the single engine aircraft Y because I was no longer watching the data tag. the air carrier x RPTED responding to a Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System II alert and RPTED the other aircraft visually. the air carrier x passed behind the single engine aircraft Y.
