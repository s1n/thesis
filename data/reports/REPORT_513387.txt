LACK of proper Air Traffic Control handoff between one approach controller on one frequency to another on another frequency caused Air Traffic Control to think a lost radio communication had occurred. leaving TMB after doing 2 practice Nondirectional Radio Beacon approaches; the miami controller on 125.5 never advised to change to 128.6. if he did advise; I did not acknowledge the frequency change; and no subsequent call from Air Traffic Control was made. when the vector last assigned took us through the localizer course of OPF; runway 9L; our destination; I called Air Traffic Control to notify. he advised to change to 128.6. the controller on 128.6 was very irate; saying 'everyone in this room has ben looking for you. I advised I just got the handoff.' training was a factor; as I could have missed the initial handoff. however; I made no acknowledgement; so a subsequent call should have been made. the 128.6 controller could have asked the 125.5 controller to call me. Visual Meteorological Conditions prevailed so traffic avoidance was not an issue.
