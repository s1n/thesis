TAXI from gate; we are required to call 1) clearance; 2) ramp control; 3) ground control. those 3 are required in the space of about 3 minute. our airline is under close scrutiny by Federal Aviation Administration. during checklist recall an incorrect response (checked instead of set) will earn us a violation. under pressure to complete CHKLISTS precisely we taxied by a spot before calling ground. we entered an active taxiway without a clearance. our zeal at making sure our CHKLISTS comply with Federal Aviation Administration standards is causing us to become near sighted. it is possible to become too much of a robot.
