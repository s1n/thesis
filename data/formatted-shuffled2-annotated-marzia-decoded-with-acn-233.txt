SITUATION began on a routine Visual Flight Rules pleasure flight into luk airport. onboard aircraft were myself; an Air Traffic Control specialist station with a commercial certificate and instrument rating and the copilot AEFII/mei. at 10 mile NE of the airport we made the initial call up with the tower. we were instructed to fly straight in to runway 20L and report a 3 mile final. at 6 mile out the local controller was working about 5-6 aircraft on 2 parallel runways. at this time the controller asked an aircraft with a call sign close to ours to identify on the transponder. I heard the controller immediately start talking to another aircraft so I assumed that the instructions were for that aircraft. again the controller asked the aircraft with close call sign to do something; and I asked if the instruction was for me. again the controller started to talk to another aircraft. then the controller asked us; using wrong tail number; to switch to runway 20R. at that time I again asked if these instructions were for us. this time he understood me and realized he was using the wrong call sign and asked me to switch to runway 20R. over the numbers for 20R I had to ask for landing clearance which was received. even though no midair or violation took place; this situation could have developed into an incident. the controller did not wait for a reply or acknowledgement to his instructions and did not hear what was being said; but heard what he expected to hear! all pilots and controllers must be made aware to listen for a correct reply and an action taken by the one receiving the instruction. if the situation continues to develop; take action and determine the problem. in this case all the controller had to do is ask; 'aircraft instructed to report 3 mile final 20L say numbers.' with this information he could have easily have controled the situation by making certain of the aircraft he needed to communicate with was us.

SOME time had passed after we had passed the RZS VFR Omni-Directional Radio Range inbound to SBP. I used my familiarization with the area'S ground lighting to determine that we were approaching the SMX-SBP area. also; I determined that due to our close proximity to the area that we needed to start a descend rather quickly. otherwise; we could not have been able to meet the LTT'S descend limitation of a maximum 1000 Feet Per Minute rate of descend and still be able to maintain a reasonable speed to the airport. I asked Air Traffic Control for a lower altitude and was assigned to 7000'. in my opinion this altitude was still too high to meet the LTT'S limitation so I started looking for the airport in order to be assigned a visual approach and unrestricted lower altitude. when approaching the SMX-SBP area from the S; SBP is the last cluster of lights sighted before continuing to the n. both the Fahrenheit/O and I sighted an airport beacon in what appeared to be the last cluster of lights. we both assumed this to be SBP so I called the airport in sight to Air Traffic Control. (we actually could not see SBP because of reduced visibility. I estimate flight visibility at approximately 20-25 mile. we did not realize this at the time.) we were approximately 35-40 mile away at the time of the call but Air Traffic Control still issued a visual approach W/O questioning as to whether or not we really had the airport in sight. the Fahrenheit/O that I was flying with was one that I considered to be above average so I was reliant on him to judge distance; speed; etc; and to set us up for a normal left traffic pattern into the airport. I focused my attention on calling and completing the descend check; calling for current weather; setting up the radios for a localizer back up and looking out for traffic and the terrain. we were approximately 4000' and on a high left downwind when I called; 'airport in sight; landing assured; cancel Instrument Flight Rules;' to Air Traffic Control. Air Traffic Control simply cancelled and wished us; 'good night.' because of the ease at which Air Traffic Control cancelled we were further Light Emitting Diode to believe that we were approaching the correct destination airport. at this point several consideration should be made as to why the controller did not question my radio call: from our position 30 mile SW at 4000'there was no way that I could have seen SBP even during daylight unlimited visibility as the airport is surrounded by hilly-mountainous terrain; 30 mile out at 4000' in no way assured us of a successful landing at SBP; the Fahrenheit/O had slowed the aircraft down to our final approach speed of 120 Knots (unusual for the LTT until short final during Visual Flight Rules operations); and we were no longer heading to SBP but directly to SMX. however; the controller cancelled W/O any hesitation or questioning. in fact; the controller gave us an audible impression that he was relieved because he no longer had to deal with us. at approximately mid-field left downwind I started making position RPTS on the Common Traffic Advisory Frequency and tried to identify the localizer. I could not receive the IDENTIFIER and assumed that we were in the non-receiving area of the localizer. because of this I commented to the Fahrenheit/O that the localizer would probably come in after we turned OPS Base Operations Office leg. both crew members were very familiar with the hilly-mountainous terrain surrounding SBP. accordingly; our attention focused on the ground lighting as that was all we could see of the terrain (it was a very dark night; no moon; no horizon; etc). both crew members continued throughout downwind and OPS Base Operations Office to concentrate on judging distance from these lights and looking for traffic with the Fahrenheit/O quickly glancing at the runway to judge his pattern work. after turning on to final I noticed that both the Horizontal Situation Indicator (Captain) and the OMNI-indicator (Fahrenheit/O) still had navigate/flags. I commented to the Fahrenheit/O that it was strange that the localizer still had not come in. the Fahrenheit/O gave no response as I gave my attention to the radios and again tried to identify the localizer. I considered the possibility of a navigate radio failure and rechecked; RETUNED the frequency; etc. I told the Fahrenheit/O that we still had navigate/flags as I started to scan the other instruments. no response was given from the Fahrenheit/O as I noticed that we were approximately 400'. I started calling out the 500' check. also; I briefly glanced outside during the check and noticed that both the approach lighting system (Automatic Landing System) and Visual Approach Slope Indicator were not on. I COMMENTEDABOUT this to the Fahrenheit/O but he did not respond. finally; the Fahrenheit/O looked over and noticed that he could not hear me speak. somehow; my hot-microphone switch was clicked to the off position (a common complaint from SFAR 41 LTT crews!). the Fahrenheit/O reached over to the left side of my control stick and turned the switch back on again keeping my attention to the inside of the cockpit. at approximately 100' and after initially calling AIRSPD and SINKRATE I started looking back outside and concentrating on the airport. I did not recognize the normal visual clues for SBP as the runway appeared to be wider and much longer and the ramp area was dark and not lit up as that of SBP'S. I tried looking for other clues but everything was moving rather quickly and was hard to identify. consequently; I asked the Fahrenheit/O if this really was SBP as I figured that he had been looking out at the airport since we had turned final. the Fahrenheit/O responded with a somewhat UNDISCERNING; 'I hope so.' at that point I decided the airport we were about to land at was apparently not that of SBP and called for a go around. unfortunately; the wheels touched simultaneously as I made the call for a go around. since the wheels had touched and I knew that we had enough runway to stop I aborted the go around and assumed control of the aircraft. during ROLLOUT my suspicions were confirmed as we both recognized the airport as SMX. (the fact that I had visual contact with the Automatic Landing System guaranteed us enough runway to land. only 2 airports in the SMX-SBP area have the Automatic Landing System and we were supposed to be landing on the shortest of the two--SBP. the other airport is SMX.) after ROLLOUT I taxied to the gate as the tower was closed; deplaned our SMX bound passenger and conferred with our dispatch.

SMT x on Instrument Flight Rules flight plan cleared to MDSD via; 'radar vectors g-3 mella g-3 MDSD.' aircraft departed and the departure controller issued; 'proceed direction BQN on course.' BQN was not on the aircraft route of flight. I; as the center controller; took the HANDOFF but due to our FDRS problem I did not have the flight strip and by the coordination with the departure controller I knew that the aircraft was going BQN on course. I assigned the aircraft FL220 and went to take care of other aircraft that needed my attention. the aircraft was W of BQN going toward mella level at FL220. I looked at the bay; and his strip was there coordinated at FL220. I terminated radar service with the aircraft; switched aircraft to MDSD about 20 mile inside SJU airspace. a few minutes later MDSD called saying that the aircraft had not shown up at mella but 15 mile to the n. these I believe were contributing factors: the aircraft originally filed SJU B520 BQN B520 MDSD. clearance delivery changed his route to g-3 mella g-3 MDSD. departure controller gave aircraft; 'direction BQN on course.' BQN was not on his clearance. I; as center controller did not have a flight strip on aircraft because our FDRS system has not been printing strips correctly for the last 3 weeks. this means the D controller has to request every strip he needs manually and has to wait for that strip to be finished printing before he can request another. the pilot assumed that after BQN he was to go direction MDSD even though his clearance did not have BQN on it.

THE transfer from toronto center to minneapolis center was missed or not given within our radio range or not given at all by toronto center. the Captain remained busy writing critiques of previous legs for submission to the company and had been preoccupied and missed several other radio calls. I delayed leaving the cockpit as longitude as possible to allow him to finish his writing. finally passing green bay I informed him I had to go aft and use the facilities prior to descend. I was gone several minutes since someone was using the lav. upon my return he said all was the same. this Captain was particularly autocratic and there had been quite a bit of tension in the cockpit. he had spent much of the trip doing the S/O'S and my job. finally passing JUDAS I asked if we HADN't received descend clearance. he said no. I persisted and asked if we SHOULDN't inquire with MSP center. he finally acquiesced; only to find he had missed the center HANDOFF. we finally re-established contact with MSP center at BITLR (MSP 086 degree radial approximately 38 Distance Measuring Equipment) intersection. we were cleared to 7000' Mean Sea Level from FL310 W/O further incident and landed normally but rushed. this incident CLRLY showed the lack of leadership by a Captain can deteriorate a crew'S performance. my company needs to establish a course for cockpit crews on resource management. this Captain did everybody else'S job including the Fahrenheit/a'S and that affected the professionalism of the rest of the crew. we left him to flounder to avoid any further lectures instead of maintaining professional vigilance.

WE were eastbound on J-8 to pails intersection. we had approximately 150K of tailwind in cruise (IE; very high ground speed). we were given clearance to cross 25 Nautical Mile W of dupont VFR Omni-Directional Radio Range at 24000'. the clearance came very late based on our ground speed. we started an immediate descent (from 33000') and had only reached FL310 when 25 Nautical Mile W of dupont. center was aware of the problem and gave us much more advanced warning of future crossing restrictions. since the flight was late in the evening and the winds had been high all day; I feel we could have been given more advanced warning of the first crossing restriction. I have seldom experienced such high tailwinds in flight; so perhaps I could have told center we wanted to start down early or perhaps tell them we would have a problem getting to the crossing altitude. supplemental information from ACN 80117: we were in cruise at FL330 with a 150 Knot direct tailwind and DIDN't plan our descent correctly to meet altitude restriction. supplemental information from ACN 80490: we had a 150K tailwind and DIDN't plan our descent correctly.

IN this part of the country ZOB will give you radar advisories only to a certain point E of the western shore of lake ST clair. for some reason; they cannot hand you off to detroit approach while they are giving you Visual Flight Rules radar advisories. they have you squawk Visual Flight Rules 1200 and on your own to contact detroit approach. this leaves you very near if not almost in 3 actual time Of arrival'S while descending for an uncontrolled field in the area; while trying to contact detroit approach immediately -- and they are usually very busy. an Instrument Flight Rules clearance was then requested. Air Traffic Control took some time to get one while still flying through the area. a visual approach was issued and Instrument Flight Rules cancelled. I think that the 2 Air Traffic Control FACS should coordinate together so that Visual Flight Rules aircraft receiving radar advisories will not be put in this tight situation. also departing WBOUND Air Traffic Control will not always answer or keep advising you to contact other approach or departure controllers for Visual Flight Rules advisories while you are climbing to avoid actual time Of arrival'S and almost in if not already over the canada border line over the lake before a controller gives you a squawk code and Visual Flight Rules advisories.

WE had just departed DCA in an MLG. after following the NE noise abatement procedures and several vectors; we were directed Area Navigation direct daily intersection on course. after passing daily we noted that the Flight Management System was tuning only 2 stations instead of the usual 4 or 5. the Flight Management System then went into dead-reckoning. we pulled out our maps and started tuning the VFR Omni-Directional Radio Range'S and correcting the course. Flight Management System had been indicating about a 70 Knot crosswind; when in fact we had 140 Knots. center advised we were 8 mile left of course and vectored us for correction. we advised them of our situation and later RPTED the Area Navigation capability inoperative. we could prevent such an incident if we backed up the Flight Management System with manual systems; however; that would defeat the whole concept of 2-Mach Number crews with high-tech computers assuming part of the workload. on a flight such as this; the only thing computers do for pilots is double the workload.

A collision hazard exists and is caused by improper airspace management procedures. there is a high VOL of aircraft requesting Visual Flight Rules practice Inertial Navigation System approaches to a user-drawn Nondirectional Radio Beacon-like approach to a commercial radio station. this broadcast station beacon is located at a point approximately 5 Statute Mile E of PRC. these aircraft enter the traffic pattern at an angle and altitude that creates a high collision hazard with aircraft arriving and departing runway 21. runway 21 is the calm wind runway and is in use the majority of time. additionally; there are a large amount of aircraft requesting Visual Flight Rules practice approaches on the VFR Omni-Directional Radio Range-a procedure to PRC. these aircraft are in conflict (opposite direction) with those making the approach from the E on the user drawn Nondirectional Radio Beacon-like procedure; particularly on the missed approach segment of the procedures. PRC tower is a non-radar Visual Flight Rules tower facility. the facility is already highly taxed with a large VOL of traffic. the tower is unable to provide any kind of meaningful traffic information to these aircraft. contributing factors: management has instructed the controllers at PRC tower to restrict the inbound traffic on the VFR Omni-Directional Radio Range-a approach procedure to at or above 6500' Mean Sea Level; and the inbound traffic on the opposite side of the airport on the Nondirectional Radio Beacon-type approach to at or above 7000' Mean Sea Level. this is a very dangerous procedure as the traffic is not in level flight; but actually descending and climbing throughout the procedure--particularly the portion of the procedure that is within the actual time Of arrival. (note: the actual time Of arrival at love field extends up to approximately 8000' Mean Sea Level.) (see attached sheets.) the controllers can always deny the approach to the users; however they are under pressure both from management and peer pressure to approve this type of operation. additionally; most controllers at PRC are at their first facility; they follow instructions from seemingly more experienced peers and do not question management'S decisions and instructions--even though sometimes; as in this example; hazards are introduced into the system. corrective actions: notify users that the user-drawn Nondirectional Radio Beacon approach is no longer valid. suggest to users that they draw an approach somewhere that is outside of the actual time Of arrival. PRC has no Nondirectional Radio Beacon approach. it is not really necessary that a Nondirectional Radio Beacon approach terminate at an airport. this should have little impact on TRNING. management should be counseled that practice Inertial Navigation System approaches constitute a special hazard. at present the management of PRC tower states that these operations are 'just another way of entering the traffic pattern.' this is not true. during a practice Inertial Navigation System approach; the safety pilot'S view is restrict by the Pilot Flying wearing a view restricting device. many incidents have pointed to the need for extra precautions (reference Aeronautical Information Manual paragraph 244). additionally; these aircraft enter the traffic pattern at unsafe angles and altitudes.

TAKING off using 'dial-a-flap' setting of 24 degree. when throttles were advanced for takeoff; false 'slat' aural warning sounded. rejected takeoff at less than 20 Knots. taxied clear of runway and reset flap/slat handle and 'dial-a-flap' wheel. subsequent takeoff was uneventful. this is an aggravating anomaly of the MLG when using flap setting of 24 degree for takeoff. callback conversation with RPTR revealed the following information. 24 degree flap is used when the aircraft is very light. company is aware of the problem and is considering discontinuing the use of 24 degree. RPTR stated that when conditions warrant the use of 24 degree he has the Fahrenheit/O set 23 degree or very carefully position the selector to 24. the more normal flap setting of 15 degree is used for the heavier takeoff weights and is primarily based on sec segment climb performance.

AT 5000' being vectored for visibility to runway 10 at BWI; advised of traffic at 10 O'clock at 4200'. unable to spot traffic and asked again about his position. 11 O'clock climbing 4700' 1 1/2 mile. (converging course) I asked for vectors away; at same time I spotted traffic coming towards us. Air Traffic Control advised a left turn. I was already in a descending right turn and advised Air Traffic Control of such. we missed by about 1/4 mile or so. would've hit the SMA otherwise. SMA was climbing through our altitude coming at us from 11 O'clock. Air Traffic Control provided no indication of converging except to tell us he (other aircraft) was E-NE bound; then provided bad turn. did not seem concerned. SMA was within Terminal Control Area limits. controller workload appeared very light.

I was told on the tower frequency that I could contact fayetteville approach on the ground on 128.15 to pick up a clearance that had been previously filed. I contacted fayetteville approach after the RUNUP and requested my clearance. the controller asked if I would be departing to the n; to which I replied affirmatively. he then said that the clearance was on request. he returned shortly and I copied my clearance which was: direct RZC the RZC 350 degree right until notified; then as filed; climb to and maintain 8000'; departure frequency of 128.15; squawk 1520; and 'hold until release.' just before approach called I noticed that the attitude indicator was not erect. approach called with my release at this time. I said that I was going to cancel; but when I brought the Revolutions Per Minute up to taxi back to the terminal the attitude indicator erected. I realized that the Revolutions Per Minute had been too low in idle to maintain the necessary vacuum so I asked to be RERELEASED and the controller complied with the clearance for takeoff. since the clouds had some rime ice; I attempted to climb through them quickly to the tops which were at about 5000'. at about the RZC VFR Omni-Directional Radio Range; just before I was going to initially contact the controller in the air; he called and asked my altitude; I replied 4900' and he replied that I had 'busted my altitude' and to return to 4000' immediately which I did within 20-30 secs. he said that there was a conflict with an airplane on approach to another airport and that the takeoff release had included a restriction for 4000' and that I needed to 'listen up.' after a few more minutes at 4000'; I was cleared to 8000' and handed off to another controller. the flight was completed W/O further unusual incident. the controller either did not issued the 4000' altitude restriction; or in the confusion with the attitude indicator; I missed the restriction. in neither case; did I acknowledge receipt of the instruction although I did acknowledge the receipt of the release. I did not observe another airplane although I was briefly in the clear before descending back to 4000'. if the controller had insisted on acknowledgement of the clearance instruction; this could have been avoided. there seemed to be lot of activity and conflict between this airport and other local airports; I noticed it on the morning of 1/91 as well as on the night before when I had come in had to hold.

THERE has been started a NDW procedure to deice/anti-ice MLG series aircraft by local policy at xxx airlines. this is in reference to the problem MLG aircraft have with ice forming on the upper wings and breaking off on takeoff and being ingested into the ENGS. the local policy is to use unheated mixture of GYCOL in a 2.5 gallon garden sprayer to apply to the wing surfaces. this procedure does not have the heat to remove and melt ice formed on the wing surface so does not remove ice from the wing surface if present. this policy was started to save GYCOL that is 'wasted' on aircraft. I have not been personally involved with this and have not used this procedure but see the problem that this does present for future operations. callback conversation with RPTR revealed the following information. mechanic RPTR indicates this policy is strictly a local policy at his maintenance station made by local management. it is his declaration that the cold GLYCOL cannot do the job sprayed from a garden hose.

Captain called 'ignition override; check fuel system.' we climbed to about 6000 feet Mean Sea Level and began to run the checklist for an engine failure. the engine (right) was developing power; but at a reduced rate. we went through the engine failure checklist and single engine in-range landing. maximum altitude was 7200 feet Mean Sea Level. after landing; braking and left engine thrust reverse was normal (as all hydraulic system functions) until braking was needed at end of runway. we had no hydraulic power to the brakes (the accumulator charge was gone). we rolled off the end of the runway at a low speed and the aircraft came to rest short of a taxiway. we did not know we had lost hydraulic pressure for there was no ANNUNCIATOR light. the thrust REVERSER of the right engine had fallen off tearing out wiring and hydraulic lines. with no warning(S) we did not have the clues for additional failures. further; we did not know that the thrust REVERSER had fallen off so; without that airborne information; we COULDN't determine what was wrong. we went on information at hand. loss of thrust REVERSER right engine. loss of hydraulic fluid due to lines being exposed. loss of brakes due to above circumstances. supplemental information from ACN 230445: a flash of the master caution for approximately 1 sec followed by a flash of the right reverse unlock light were the only cockpit indications that we got. the brakes failed at 80 Knots. we departed the runway at the departure end to the left to avoid a fence. we did a 180 degree turn using reverse thrust from the left engine. the left main gear sunk in a ditch which stopped the aircraft.

DURING an Instrument Flight Rules flight from alliance; NE; to rockford; IL; I experienced loss of oil pressure on the left engine of an SMA. I immediately requested vectors to the nearest airport which was sac city (ski). during the descent to landing; the oil pressure dropped to red line on the left engine so I shut it down and feathered the propeller. I experienced no other difficulties during the flight. the next day (I waited for daylight to inspect the cause); the mechanic and I discovered that the throttle cable was resting against the oil filter. it appeared that; over time; engine vibration had caused the throttle cable to rub a hole in the oil filter causing the loss of pressure when it finally broke through. the mechanic replaced the filter and secured the throttle so it WOULDN't occur again. this problem could not be seen during a PREFLT because it requires removing the cowling to see the filter and throttle cable. I believe this problem would never have occurred if the mechanic that performed the previous 100 hour inspection had properly secured the throttle cable instead of allowing it to rest on the oil filter.

I asked the tower to 'say again' at least 1 more time and it may have been twice. since we were already crossing runway 35R; we heard cleared to cross again ('anticipating' 35L) and still looking for taxiway lima. when we found ourselves at kilo; we both realized that lima was behind us and the runway we had just crossed was an active runway without clearance. other factors: neither the Captain nor I had been in that area of the airport before. it was the Captain'S first landing in that type of aircraft. I am a low-time First Officer in that type of airplane. anticipation -- normally when told to switch to ground control at most airports; you are cleared to cross active runways. supplemental information from ACN 260235: I did not know where 'lima' was and asked copilot. he was looking up maps and doing after landing CHKLISTS and did not answer. I looked for lima sign but did not see one. an aircraft was on short final for runway 35R so I was trying to hustle a heavy ship across and probably missed the lima sign between runway 35R/35L (I assume it'S there). we received clearance again to turn left on lima -- now I had a mindset it was on the other side of runway 35L. we both looked and saw no aircraft on runway 35L and continued across. I also thought that because we were on ground; he hand crossed us. it also was my first landing after training in this craft. I was also trying to adjust my cockpit lights (which I could not find). I should have stopped the moment I was not absolutely sure of the clearance. although we had taxi maps handy; lima was not easily apparent to us. I believe I heard what I expected; 'cross 35L;' not what the controller said; because it was the second or third clearance to cross.

DATE of incident began with unwanted wake-up at hotel about XA00 am from loud disturbance outside room by hotel guests apparently retiring after party on lower level. unable to go back to sleep; anticipating XB00 am wake-up call. cockpit PREFLT found Ground Proximity Warning System fail light inoperative. found bulbs missing; replaced bulbs; then tested normal. clearance obtained; CHKLISTS completed. after boarding passenger; closed cabin door and had entire aircraft DE-iced. during CLBOUT shortly after takeoff; Ground Proximity Warning System 'terrain' warning sounded frequently but intermittently; with radio altimeter needle jumping wildly between 0 feet to 2500 feet altitude indications. climb continued at maximum power used for takeoff; and 'terrain' warnings continued; creating concern as well as distraction. ottawa Standard Instrument Departure called for flying runway heading for radar vectors to 5000 feet. additionally; noise abatement procedures suggested climb to 3000 feet before proceeding on course. although the 'terrain' warnings were experienced on previous occasions following deicing; passing approximately 2000 feet Mean Sea Level; began right turn toward yup beacon; knowing terrain was lower toward S. departure controller later gave a heading for direct SYR; which was acknowledged; then inquired as to the right turn; instead of maintaining runway heading per the Standard Instrument Departure. First Officer replied turn was made toward the yup beacon; but did not indicate turn prompted by Ground Proximity Warning System warnings. controller then responded; 'ok.' obviously; the turn resulted in deviation from the published Standard Instrument Departure. Ground Proximity Warning System warnings finally ceased above 10000 feet Mean Sea Level about the time pulling circuit breakers was discussed (per AFM procedures). throughout departure and CLBOUT; Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System II display showed no conflict with any other aircraft. flight continued routinely to destination airport. in hindsight; would have been appropriate to advise controller of warnings by Ground Proximity Warning System; and requesting right turn prior to commencing same.

AFTER leaving the deicing area at the ramp; flight left for taxiway D9. on taxiway D9 we were making a left turn on taxiway D. while the Captain began to make the turn; I was asked a question from the flight attendant. I turned back to answer her question; turned my head back to the front of the aircraft and realized the nose of the aircraft had left the taxiway. the Captain said that the NOSEWHEEL did not respond to the turn. we were taxiing extremely slow using only the #1 engine. engine was shut down; ground notified; and maintenance notified. maintenance arrived at the aircraft; inspected the aircraft and determined that the NOSEWHEEL had just departed the taxiway. no damage was evident to the NOSEWHEEL. maintenance told us to power back the aircraft. it was discussed in the cockpit. I checked my book and could not find a procedure and told the Captain. Captain and First Officer discussed it. both had PWRED back aircraft before. decided to power back the aircraft. all ENGS started; aircraft was PWRED back. we taxied back to the gate and wrote up the NOSEWHEEL in the aircraft forms. the aircraft was inspected; determined to be okay and the flight continued to FWA. things learned from this incident: should not have talked to flight attendant during taxi; even though I physically could not do anything to stop the aircraft from skidding. when I see that there is no procedure in the book; you don't think about doing it.

FLT aircraft began with an uneventful PUSHBACK from ord gate engine start and departure salute. clearance was received from ramp control to switch to ground metering. very shortly thereafter; I noticed what I thought was a burning smell. I asked First Officer if she smelled something burning. she replied affirmatively and shortly thereafter stated 'you know what; we have smoke in here.' she was correct and the concentration of smoke seemed to be increasing. almost simultaneously; flight attendant #1 informed me that there was smoke in the back and they were attempting to locate the source. I knew that no deicing fluid had been sprayed on the aircraft since our arrival and asked First Officer if there was any sign of deicing fluid on the ramp during her walk around. she replied negatively. because we were still a 90 degree turn from being able to return to gate. I instructed First Officer to inform ramp control of our situation and that we wished to return to gate. clearance was received and we turned towards the gate -- waited what seemed at the time like an excessive time; but in hindsight was probably not; for a GUIDEMAN and parked at the gate. in addition to the parking checklist -- packs and RECIRCULATION fans were shut off. the flight attendants subsequently informed me that the smoke in the cabin seemed to be emanating from somewhere in the middle of the cabin and had subsequently dissipated. the cockpit smoke also seemed to dissipate after reaching the gate. after reaching the gate; I instructed the passenger to leave the aircraft through the front entry door. a flight attendant Public Address subsequently instructed the passenger to leave their personal belongings on the aircraft. the evacuation proceeded uneventfully through the JETBRIDGE. an appropriate E6 entry was made followed by a verbal description to maintenance personnel who subsequently removed the aircraft from service. dispatch called the JETBRIDGE phone to request details which were provided.

I had just finished a phantom approach with a stall. I increased power and climbed approximately to 5000 feet above ground level. I experienced loss of thrust followed by a knocking -- buzzing noise that progressed into violent shaking of the aircraft. I first leveled the aircraft; then went through emergency procedures. I throttled back and flew the airplane at 80 Knots; but the aircraft was still violently shaking. I tried to dial 121.5 and could not. I prepared to make an immediate landing. we spotted a field at our 2 O'clock and I set up for an approach. while setting up for the landing; I pulled the mixture full lean and increased the power to 1500 Revolutions Per Minute to kill the engine; but the engine would not quit. I throttled back and slipped the plane until 20 feet above ground level. I straightened the plane and did a 2 point landing; let the nose wheel down; and applied brakes. the engine would not shut down; so I turned the magnetic switch off when the Revolutions Per Minute fluctuated to its slowest cycle. it WASN't till after the engine shut down; that I then noticed that the propeller was missing 5 inches off the tip. then I made contact with WJF.

I entered a left downwind for the S runway and landed the aircraft safely. an inspection was made to the aircraft and there was no damage found. there was also no damage to the airport property.

I was the Pilot Flying inbound to KMLI and the Captain as the Pilot Not Flying picked up the Automatic Terminal Information Service for KMLI and relayed the information to me. there was no mention of runway 31 being unusable. we saw the airport beacon and as we continued towards KMLI; we found ourselves lined up for runway 31. we requested a straight-in visual to runway 31 from the quad cities approach controller. we received clearance for the visual approach to runway 31 and we were instructed to contact the tower. the Captain contacted quad cities tower and we were given clearance to land on runway 31. after we landed; we were asked to phone the tower. the Captain phoned the tower and the tower controller said we were not approved for landing on runway 31 and he referenced a new Notice To Airmen for KMLI. in our weather package there was a new Notice To Airmen that read 'MLI 31 closed landing air carrier PS ATX PS aircraft with approach speed over 120 Knots.' having read this prior to landing; we appeared legal since we were given clearance to landon runway 31 and our approach speed is not over 120 Knots. I believe this possible infraction could have been prevented by the Flight Crew'S better understanding of what the poorly written Notice To Airmen intended to say. we interpreted the Notice To Airmen as runway 31 being closed to air carrier/ATX aircraft with an approach speed over 120 Knots; not as being closed to all air carrier and ATX aircraft. a mention of the runway not being usable in the Automatic Terminal Information Service would have also prevented this infraction. as a last resource; notification from the approach or from tower saying the runway is not usable to air carrier aircraft; but instead they gave us clearance for both the visual approach to runway 31 and landing clearance to runway 31. callback conversation with RPTR revealed the following information: RPTR states that he called his dispatch office for clarification of the Notice To Airmen. dispatch indicated that the PS equals a plus sign which the equipment cannot make. in speaking with controller; he indicated it was his interpretation that the Notice To Airmen meant no air carrier aircraft could use the runway. if this was the case; RPTR wonders why he would be cleared to land on that runway??? RPTR was advised of the hot line number to further follow up on the problem. supplemental information from ACN 292915: we asked for a visual straight-in to runway 31. this was approved by approach control. checking in with tower; a landing clearance was obtained for runway 31. any one of several things would have prevented this: the Flight Crew'S better understanding of a poorly written new Notice To Airmen; a mention of the change on the Automatic Terminal Information Service or; as a last line of defense; notification from approach or tower control; the approving agency. callback conversation with RPTR revealed the following information: the RPTR was advised that 'PS' is a legal Federal Aviation Administration abbreviation for 'plus;' therefore; his air carrier aircraft with an approach speed less than 120 Knots was included in this proscription.

B-700 model navigate display showed us heading nearly directly to 'NAPSE' which has an 'at or below 7000 feet restrict.' we decided until we could get an answer to what restrict he was talking about; we would maintain 7000 feet until abeam NAPSE and then climb. about the time we were abeam NAPSE; the controller answered our question -- that there was no restrict on a radar vector. the manner and tone of the controller was as if we were total idiots. moments later; he had issued the same; 'comply with RESTRS' to another air carrier. this guy asked the same question we did; and added; 'why are you saying comply with RESTRS if there are none?' the controller answered; 'because I have to.' this controller was confusing everyone. if there are no RESTRS; then why is he saying; 'comply with RESTRS?' he is creating his own problems; and then the frequency becomes congested with everyone trying to figure out what to do. callback conversation with RPTR revealed the following information: RPTR has not returned to las since this event.

I was flying a course of 145 degree true between smartville and auburn. at 5500 feet I was flying over clouds that were becoming taller and more frequent. this concerned me enough that I wanted to get under them before too longitude so that I could land at auburn. I had passed smartville a few minutes earlier; however I thought I was further along on my route than I actually was. wanting to radio Flight Service Station and close my flight plan before nearing auburn; I canceled flight following with approach and began my descent to 3500 feet. (I believe this was my first and worst mistake that Light Emitting Diode to the incursion.) beale'S class Celsius shelf runs from 2600 feet to 4100 feet in this area. after radioing Flight Service Station; I began to realize that I was not seeing what I expected on the ground below.

I continued to try and figure my location from landmarks; holding my heading while I assessed the situation. I was varying my altitude with the OPS Base Operations Office of the clouds during this time. then I remembered that this aircraft had a Global Positioning System that might help. the Global Positioning System was flashing that it had a message for me; which was that I was in beale'S airspace. according to the Global Positioning System; I was at the outermost edge. however; this was when I noticed it. I am sure I was inside for longer than this. I continued to hold course; as this would be the quickest way out (within 30 seconds). I could not climb; due to clouds; and I was hesitant to descend due to my disorientation. once out of class Celsius; I returned my attention to navigate. it turned out that I was on proper course; thankfully. my disorientation appears to have been limited to distance traveled. lessons: always have flight following when flying over/near controled airspace. I had not seen this as needed since my planned altitude was 5500 feet; well over beale'S airspace. however; weather changed my plans and my altitude. I did not respond appropriately. I continued on with my PRE-planned sequence of events after beginning my descent. if I would have just stayed with flight following; this would have been a non-event. be aware of disorientation.

I was landing at GLE at about XA00 jan/XA/04. the Automated Weather Observation System and NOTAMS indicated a displaced threshold of 1000 feet for runway 17. there were wooden barricades (about 4 feet high) with chevron markers indicating the area where workers were doing runway maintenance. on landing; there were several workers standing about 20 feet to each side of the CTRLINE; but remained standing on the usable part of the runway. I extended my flare over them. I believe they should be clear of the active part of the runway; or the barricaded area should have been extended to include the runway areas where they were working. I believe their lives were in danger. they were standing at the 'new' threshold marking; which was about 100 feet past the barricades. on departure; I was back-taxiing to reach the beginning of the runway; so as to use all the available runway. once again; I passed the workers; milling around on the runway; towards the barricades. after passing them; I noticed they had been painting a new threshold line (on the active part of the runway). one of the workers who was on the local Common Traffic Advisory Frequency yelled at me to turn around and clear the area. I complied and departed. summary: the problem/danger I see here is that; while they are working on the new markings; they are not protected in any way. PROCEDURALLY; it may make more sense to include the area they were marking within the barricaded area. once the lines are marked; the barricades could be moved further back to only include the area being resurfaced. the partial markings were not sufficient to protect them. on landing; the workers on the runway were past the newly painted 'WIP' area -- presenting a danger to themselves and pilots. perhaps some training in avoiding landing planes would be appropriate.

I asked the First Officer to take control of the aircraft while I went outside to inspect the damage. when I determined that the flight would be delayed until maintenance could inspect the propeller; I returned to the cockpit and taxied the aircraft to a remote parking spot on the ramp. inspection of the propeller indicated it had struck a traffic one. we contacted dispatch and maintenance via the telex and made an appropriate AML entry. causes: 1) traffic cone situated in the middle of the ramp area. 2) absence of painted lines for taxi RTES and parking locations. 3) failure to taxi forward before starting the right turn and follow usual taxi route. 4) failure of the First Officer to properly check the area was clear; instead of focusing on a new departure procedure. 5) First Officer'S unfamiliarity with new airport and route. remedies: 1) removal of traffic cones from the ramp area unless they are being used in the immediate vicinity of parked aircraft. 2) taxi lines and designated parking areas need to be permanently painted on the ramp. 3) I should have provided a PREFLT briefing to the First Officer covering the departure procedure prior to starting the taxi.

IMMEDIATELY after liftoff KWK tower instructed us to turn right (WBOUND) and proceed 'on course; contact CVG approach control.' immediately contacted CVG approach to be told that we were entering the class B airspace without prior clearance. this is the sort of clearance confusion that causes accidents in airspace transition areas. when one Air Traffic Control facility issues instructions to an aircraft; it should be assumed that those instructions have been coordinated and approved by the next Air Traffic Control facility; especially in very close airspace transition areas! you can't wander all over the area awaiting approval at 140 Knots; and you obviously can't stop. it is assumed that whenever cleared you will have sufficient time to clean up the aircraft and contact departure without becoming an unwanted imposition on your next Air Traffic Control sector. please work to improve this type of Visual Flight Rules handoff/coordination.

FIRST; I am an Instrument Flight Rules flight instructor and know better than to let this happen. I had just purchased this airplane and was delayed getting airborne after a lengthy PREFLT. up to this point I had been flying full Instrument Flight Rules panel aircraft; daily. this plane had only an ill-functioning 720 communication and mode Celsius transponder; no navigate equipment. I was dead-reckoning to a maintenance facility in Public Address (haven't done that in a while) while my attention was trying to get my communication radio functioning. I drifted too close to DCA area. I thought I was under class B limitations; area published is 10000 feet/4500 feet. I am very comfortable communicating with Air Traffic Control and make it a priority INFLT so as to avoid this very thing. my error was focusing too longitude on trying to get my communication radio working while piloting an aircraft; I was solo. I realized my error visually and immediately made corrections in dead-reckoning to avoid this class B airspace. dead-reckoning became my priority as I flew past the DCA area; fredericks (FDK) and prohibited area P-40. I then refocused my attention on radios after passing littlestown; Public Address; and got my radio functioning by york; Public Address (THV). lancaster control tower was the agency that told me to contact potomac radar. I was then informed that the IAD Terminal Control Area was active to the surface and not at the published lower level of 4500 feet Mean Sea Level. my Flight Service Station briefer did not mention this. understand; I know this infraction is my error; I did not track my intended flight as I wanted or planned. and it will not ever happen again. POSITIONAL awareness is always priority. I teach my students this and yet failed to do it myself. by flying everyday; having received flight instructor of the YR awards; complacency has slapped me in the face. I've learned something today.

3 of the last 4 times I have flown into san diego and parked at gate XX; there has been an S80 parked in between gate XY and XX. it is so close to the yellow painted taxi line that if I had taxied into gate XX exactly on the yellow line; the left wingtip would have impacted my right wing about 1/3 of the wing span in from the wingtip. every time this occurred; there was a B767 parked at gate XZ. this means there is absolutely no way to safely taxi from the airport taxiway into the ramp area and into the gate. even with wing walkers; this is risky. the first 2 times I had this occur; I did taxi in with wing walkers; but notified the station management personnel on duty at the time that it was unsafe. both times; the station personnel acknowledged it was less than safe; both times station personnel acknowledged pilots complained about the situation. both times station personnel acknowledged this was a routine -- daily situation. for goodness sake; do we have to bend metal to get it through to the san folks that unsafe means there is a reasonable risk of damage to equipment and injury to personnel involved here? it took me over 40 minutes to finally get ground personnel to approach the airplane so I could get a tug to pull me in. I tried radio calls; I tried flashing my nose light and I even resorted to using my cell phone to try to get operations and or maintenance on the line. if this parking is necessary due to constrained ramp space at san; for goodness sake get a red and yellow clear area painted around where the airplane; between XY and XX; is parked and get an accurate measurement of a clear taxi area in to the gate and paint it on the ramp so we can proceed safely. if you are short man power to do it; get me the paint and I'LL fly out on my days off and paint it.

AFTER level off at FL330; the ride quickly deteriorated to moderate chop. we asked the controller about rides; and he said that they were worse higher; but lower was better. we stuck with the ride for a while to see if it would improve; but it did the opposite. we descended to FL290 with the intent of climbing back up when the rides higher improved. they never did improve. we cut corners with direct routing; flew Flight Management System optimum speed; and kept the fuel close to the flight plan. fuel abeam SSO was 100 pounds above planned. after SSO; the fuel began to fall behind with 500 pounds below abeam EWM and 1100 pounds below at TQA. we were given FL270 for traffic. I calculated that landing fuel would be 4.7. on initial contact with ZFW; I told the controller that fuel was tight and could we get direct to hirst or fever. he said jen was the best he could do. on each frequency change; I restated the request. about 70 mile from jen and at FL240 on a 080 degree heading to jen; the controller told us to turn right 120 degree for spacing into DFW. I told him that we would be unable for fuel. he replied in a sarcastic tone; 'you mean you are refusing the vector?' I replied that we were 'low on fuel; could you give us any other options?' he said; 'no; this is a vector in trail.' I replied that we were 'minimum fuel and if we take the turn we will be emergency fuel.' we were then handed off to another controller; given direct to hirst with an expeditious arrival and approach. landing fuel was 5.0 with 4.6 at the gate. if we had taken the in trail vector; landing fuel would have been below 4.0. here are a few observations on this event: 1) the tight fuel plan gave us few options to deal with the UNFORECAST turbulence en route (moderate entire route instead of light chop TFD to SSO). 2) a series of events resulted in the inability to take extended vectors on arrival to DFW. 3) the DFW controller seemed to be playing some power game. I was merely trying to convey our tight fuel condition and provide for the safe operation of the flight. I feel that I was professional and polite in my XMISSIONS with the controllers. 4) this type of event will probably be fairly common with the current fuel loads we are given. there is a point at which you push the fuel savings too Federal Aviation Regulation.

WHILE crossing runway 4; we were given a left turn onto taxiway BB; hold short of taxiway Y. I glanced at taxiway BB from the airport diagram and noted no RESTRS. my focus of attention was redirected back to visual taxi lookout. when stopped and holding short of taxiway Y; as directed by ground control; we noticed that while there is no restrict for B757'S on taxiway BB; there is a restrict from turning either direction off of taxiway BB. in other words; it is a dead-end for B757'S. the Captain called the chief pilot on duty and discussed the situation. we were informed that if we could safely taxi with wing walkers we could proceed from taxiway BB; left on taxiway Y then left on taxiway AA. this we did with port authority/authorized wing walkers and at no time was there a question of adequate wing clearance. the chief pilot on call was a tremendous help. I recommend a note be added on the airport page restricting B757'S from even turning onto taxiway BB; left from taxiway D. LGA taxiing is very tight; quick and dynamic and requires outside safety lookout at all times.

AFTER landing at XYZ hospital in ZZZ for a patient transport; I was notified by the lead mechanic via cell phone that we had overflown a component on the #1 engine and the helicopter was Out Of Service for maintenance. I notified nursing staff and coordination the second aircraft to transport the patient. the component; the #1 engine flow fence actuator; had been overflown by over 60 hours. contributing factors for this incident include: 1) failure of the pilots and MECHS to verify the total time for the total engine time versus the component change time. 2) failure of the company to provide timely maintenance status records. 3) assumptions that the most current and timely components are tracked by the company records section and contract sites will be notified if a component is due to be changed. 4) assumption by the pilots that the MECHS are keeping track of all component change times and vice VERSA. 5) a recent change of the company record keeping policies. callback conversation with RPTR revealed the following information: the cause of the overfly is the flight crew'S and technician'S failure to monitor engine total time and check with component change time. the function of the flow fence is control and limit the air and fuel feed to the engine.

ENG start at ZZZ1 required jumping the aircraft'S battery from the lineman'S truck. once started; the aircraft'S electrical system appeared to be functioning normally. while taxiing for departure; the radio intermittently XMITTED to ground control; but operated for tower communications. while executing the departure climb; we experienced electrical system failure. the failure occurred immediately after the tower handoff to departure control during the initial climbing left turn toward the VFR Omni-Directional Radio Range. radio frequency lights were blank/out; indicating no power from the alternator or battery. no circuit breakers were observed to have extended. radio contact with HANDHELD transceivers was attempted without success. the FPR was then flown. the transponder was left on 'altitude' at first in the event it was able to transmit the lost communication 7600 code. approximately 10 minutes into the flight; the aircraft'S battery/alternator switches were turned off to preserve whatever power may have been available for landing operations. Global Positioning System receiver'S internal batteries (not ship'S power) were used to navigate. weather was night Visual Meteorological Conditions with good visibility. while approaching ZZZ2; the battery/master switch was again turned on; which illuminated the external navigate lights momentarily. the COMRDO frequency display and external position lights momentarily lit and a radio call was made to ZZZ2 tower with no response. the radio display and lights again failed at this point. after the last route fix on the flight plan; we proceeded to fly toward ZZZ2 paralleling the runway 24 Instrument Landing System on the right side using the Global Positioning System receivers. landing was made via short straight-in final approach onto runway 24. human performance considerations: I presumed the flight was being followed on radar; so continued the route to the destination airport in night Visual Meteorological Conditions. I chose to treat night Visual Meteorological Conditions as if it were Instrument Meteorological Conditions lost communications and flew the FPR; believing the route was protected airspace for the proposed time of the flight with the aircraft'S radar track being followed. my intention was to land safely at an airport with functioning runway lights. I considered landing at monmouth executive; robbinsville; and princeton; but each had pilot controled lighting which we would not be able to activate. I chose ZZZ2 as the most safe airport because it is most familiar to me and I believed the route was protected airspace where we were expected to be per our Instrument Flight Rules flight plan and proposed time en route. approaching ZZZ2; we attempted to listen to Automatic Terminal Information Service on HANDHELD transceivers with no success. since the airplane had no lights or radios; I chose not to circle the airport/tower believing it futile to be seen by engine sound alone for the tower to send a light gun signal. I believed circling an often busy airport with no lights or radio would be an unsafe choice. I chose to land on runway 24. the landing was made with a short final approach; and we quickly cleared the runway at the first taxiway. upon landing I called the tower to advise on the above.

AT approximately XA:21 a strong burning odor entered the cockpit followed by smoke from the area around the left GLARESHIELD panel. both the Captain and the First Officer donned oxygen and smoke goggles and we initiated emergency procedures for electrical fire/smoke. we called an emergency call with ZZZ and requested an immediate diversion to the closest airport. the amount of smoke coming from the panel was significant and steady but we could not establish a source or an area where heat was building up. the First Officer was the flying pilot and the Captain handled the checklist and radio communications. the checklist was followed and we lost communications and navigation capabilities due to the loss of power to those systems. this allowed us to isolate the problem to the PS1 bus because the smoke stopped. I then REPOWERED the aircraft and re-established communication with ZZZ. we received a clearance to divert to ZZZZ; First Officer; and a 7700 squawk. once established towards ZZZZ; I began to load-shed the aircraft. the left side alternator; generator; windshield heat; PITOT heat; Electronic Flight Instrument System; and lighting were turned off as well as the high frequency when contact with ZZZ was established. two circuit breakers were tripped on the electrical panel; the cabin lights and Electronic Flight Instrument System SYB gen 3. the flight time to ZZZZ; First Officer; was about 40 minutes. once in the descent the cabin dump valve was opened to allow clearance of the smoke in the cabin. the smoke did not obscure vision; but did cause a noticeable haze. high frequency#2 failed and that made it necessary to have power on high frequency#1 longer than wanted. a failure of the emergency mask intercom made it necessary for me to have my mask off to communication effectively with the First Officer. approximately 12 minutes from ZZZZ; First Officer; the bus tie was opened and all power to PS1 was closed. the smoke stopped at this point. heat was beginning to build up noticeably on the left GLARESHIELD panel before the bus tie was closed. no flames were noticed but the smoke was consistent. after landing with most of the aircraft systems UNPOWERED; we shut the aircraft down without further incident. the Captain was treated and released from the hospital for smoke inhalation. callback conversation with RPTR revealed the following information: the First Officer was flying and the Captain was going through the checklist and isolated the PS1 bus causing the smoke to stop. the loads were shed on the PS1 bus and two circuit breakers were found tripped; one being cabin lighting. reaching 2000 feet the outflow valve was opened to clear out the smoke. the Captain was treated for smoke inhalation due to failure of the emergency mask intercom as it was removed to communication with the First Officer. maintenance found the cockpit lighting rheostat dimmer was overheated due to a screw cutting the output wiring insulation and shorting out the rheostat. this was controled by the circuit breaker found tripped that was labeled cabin lighting.

AFTER block out; prior to departure; holding short of runway (weather 100 over 1/4 mile BR); and upon doing the control check when exercising the rudder to the left; both the First Officer and myself noticed a loud rumbling and shudder through the aircraft; almost as if the rudder was fluttering at its extreme end of travel. the shudder was even felt by a JUMPSEATER. a vibration was felt through the rudder pedals throughout the full range of travel; getting worse at the end of travel. upon neutralizing the rudder and exercising it to the right; the same problem occurred; but to a lesser degree. (note -- the rudder check was accomplished very slowly per a critique on an earlier line check). both crew members exercised the rudder slowly; with the problem getting seemingly worse with each cycle of the rudder. the runway required flaps 15/20; so just as an experiment; the First Officer and myself tried exercising the rudder with various flap/slat settings with the same result. I called the gate and informed them I would be returning to the blocks. upon block in; maintenance boarded the aircraft with the ENGS running. we demonstrated our rudder check to the mechanic and when he felt and heard the problem; his comment was; 'oh my gosh!' we shut down the aircraft and powered up the hydraulics so the mechanic could observe the rudder from outside. maintenance told us that the rudder appeared to move further to the left; after it had achieved full travel via the pedal. a log entry was made and a consultation with maintenance control began. the crew received conflicting information from maintenance control. initially; we were told that they had a bulletin stating that the rudder'S excessive vibration was normal if the A300 was light; which it was. upon receiving a copy of this 'bulletin;' which in reality was a small footnote from a maintenance manual; we learned that weight had nothing to do with this rudder problem; but in fact had to do with the speed of the rudder travel check. in my opinion; maintenance control was insinuating we had exercised the rudder too quickly; which was not the case. I then inquired if there was anything else that could be checked to troubleshoot this problem. we were told by maintenance control that the only other check they were going to do was the same check the mechanic had done for the PRE-departure; which involves powering up the hydraulics and accomplishing a normal control check. this check had been done prior to the crews' arrival and no problems were noted. the problem occurred after block out. the mechanic did as maintenance control instructed and the aircraft was signed off as ok to return to service. I was informed by maintenance control that this was all they were going to do; nothing else was necessary. however; the same seemingly abnormally strong rudder vibrations and the shuddering of the aircraft and rudder pedals existed after the mechanic accomplished maintenance control'S maintenance procedures. I am concerned that there may have been pressure from maintenance control to accept an aircraft that was exhibiting the same problematic symptoms after the maintenance procedures were accomplished and no further investigation was deemed necessary. contributing factors in my decision not to depart included the very low weather and the hostile terrain surrounding the airport. after extended conversations; I was informed that we (myself and the First Officer) were removed from the flight and a management crew was being sent to rescue the aircraft.callback conversation with RPTR revealed the following information: the RPTR stated that maintenance operations was contacted by the RPTR and after relating the rudder actions; the technician again checked the rudder operation with the same results; shuddering; rumbling; and vibration in the rudder pedals. maintenance operations made the claim the rudder operation was normal for a lightly loaded airplane and made it appear the rudder was moved rapidly during the test. the rudder inputs were slow and per procedure. the justification for this airplane being serviceable was a small footnote from the maintenance manual that had nothing to do with weight of the aircraft. the RPTR'S decision to refuse the airplane was tempered by the weather; local terrain and the belief this airplane was not right.

I asked for full flaps and horn beeped. immediately I recognized I had forgotten the gear and called for gear extension. I asked Captain if he'D like a go around; but by this time everything had 'come together' and looked good; so we landed. I could easily have made taxiway k; but popped off brakes and coasted to end of runway 4R. we wound up 'walking away from another one' which we do after every flight. possibly no one would ever know if I DIDN't write this report. in my 30TH YR of flying; this is quite disturbing to me. not something I ever want to see! had we all not been so fatigued and distraction; I do not think I would have forgotten the gear; and I do not think both the Captain and bunkie would have let me go so Federal Aviation Regulation without lowering the gear either! even though he DIDN't say anything; I strongly believe the bunkie added an extra layer of safety that would have prevented us from landing with the gear up. lesson learned is that even with easily over 100 YRS flying experience in the cockpit; mistakes can be made; and we need to be ever vigilant. I will do my best to never let this happen again. supplemental information from ACN 682843: late in lowering gear and completing checklist. very tired; all-night flight from ZZZ-HNL. unable to get nap at hotel prior to departure because maids make excessive noise in halls and adjacent rooms. distraction approaching Final Approach Fix by tower admonishing another airline flight for taxiing onto a runway without those instructions -- several very caustic XMISSIONS by tower to the aircraft. then tower told us to look for traffic crossing between us and the runways from E to W that would be landing on runway 4L; IE; their OPS Base Operations Office turn was across the final approach course to runway 4R. it took us awhile to spot this traffic. these DISTRS with being tired allowed us to be late in final CONFIGN. no mandatory go around automated notifications were sounded or displayed; however; FOM guidance of gear down and final check accomplished by Final Approach Fix or 1500 feet was violated. we deemed continuing for landing was a safer course of action than to go around with tiredness and high terrain to the n and E of airport. landing made in normal touchdown zone; on speed.

AS I rotated the aircraft and lifted off the aircraft started a roll to the right. I immediately corrected and kept wings level. I initially thought I had lost an engine as the roll was consistent with an engine loss but I did not have any adverse yaw. I checked ENGS and they were normal. I had no problem with controling the roll but it required about 5-6 units of left wing down aileron input to maintain wings level. at no time during this entire flight was there a problem with maintaining wings level so longitude as we maintained 5-6 units of left aileron trim. as we climbed out; the First Officer and I were analyzing the situation. the aircraft would trim out fine and could be flown 'hands off' with the 5-6 units of left wing down aileron yoke displacement. I did not use Auto-Pilot. we referred to the Quick Reference Handbook and used the rudder UNCOMMANDED yaw/roll checklist (this is for the rudder but was the closest checklist that pertained to this problem). we accomplished the items but nothing changed. all circuit breaker'S were in. we checked for fuel imbalance; but gauges checked good and read even. hydraulic pressures and quantities were normal. flaps were up and Light Emitting Diode lights were out. all indications in the cockpit were normal. I called the flight attendants asked them to look at the wing and to tell me what they saw. they RPTED the left wing spoilers were up slightly (3-6 inches) and the right wing was normal. we observed the left aileron was slightly up and the right one also seemed slightly up. left wing was consistent with the control column input; while the right wing was neither normal nor consistent with out input. we initiated contact with dispatch and had maintenance control on the call. we advised them as to our situation and asked for any suggestions. we had already accomplished their suggestions and maintenance duty told us they would have maintenance meet us in ZZZ. I requested dispatch bring up the chief pilot on duty. I advised him of our situation and suggested we divert to ZZZ1 (the closest field at this time). he concurred and the flight was diverted. we declared an emergency with Air Traffic Control. I informed the passenger of our situation telling them we were going to land in ZZZ1 as a precaution. I told the flight attendants to secure the cabin for a normal landing and told them not to prepare the cabin. I did not tell the passenger I had declared an emergency. we descended into ZZZ1. we slowed the aircraft slowly to ensure we had no CONTROLLABILITY problems. we configured early and slowly configured; stabilizing the aircraft at each flap setting. we flew a wide visual approach with Instrument Landing System backup. I flew a slightly fast final (+10 or so) as the aircraft was very stable at that speed. we landed normally. after we cleared the runway we canceled the emergency. after shutdown; maintenance told us a control cable had broken.callback conversation with RPTR revealed the following information: RPTR stated that the aircraft'S CONTROLLABILITY was never in question; adding that the aircraft was a little slower turning than with both ailerons but safety of flight was not in question. on the ground RPTR could see a control cable hanging loose and was told by maintenance that it was the right aileron control cable.

I acknowledged; we were both in terrain mode for Ground Proximity Warning System on 10 mile scale. we talked about the mountain and towers straight ahead. we initiated takeoff and I thought the clearance negated the note in the takeoff section of commercial chart which stated; 'right-hand turn mandatory; hazard beacons on hills to E; must be visible.' conditions were clear/Visual Meteorological Conditions; visibility 10+ mile; temperature 27 degree; altimeter 30.03. we could both see the hills and towers. on takeoff; I told Captain the closest turn would be left for on course (approximately 140 degree versus 220 degree to right). at no time were we any nearer the hills in the left turn than if we would have turned right. after approximately 90 degree of turn; the controller said we 'were in a heap of trouble and we better say our best prayers.'

I issued the current altimeter and advised the pilot of the possible discrepancy. the pilot acknowledged that his mode Celsius was not correct. I called TUL to advise them of the aircraft'S position; altitude; and mode Celsius problem. the controller at TUL told me to 'stand by.' not having the authority/authorized to climb or turn the departure without permission from TUL; this allowed the aircraft to penetrate the 5 mile safety zone of the antenna. contributing factors: pilot departing with faulty transponder. poor procedure of aiming aircraft at a known obstacle at an altitude that is below the Minimum Vector Altitude.

I set this in the Flight Control Unit window. as we descended through about 5000 feet I stated that the current heading would take us over some terrain and obstacles that are charted at 2791 feet. these features were visual and at 12 O'clock position. there is terrain with radio towers situated on top. at about 4500 feet the Captain decreased the rate of descent; and at about 4000 feet the descent rate was minimal -- maybe 200 Feet Per Minute down. the EGPWS display was displaying light green -- corresponding to the terrain ahead. as the aircraft passed over the top of the obstacles we received a Ground Proximity Warning System mode 2A warning: 'terrain; terrain...pull up; pull up.' the Captain applied toga power and began a pitch up. almost immediately the warning ceased -- and the warning lights extinguished. the aircraft had really not even responded (yet) to the commanded maneuver (IE; it happened so fast beginning to end). the Captain retarded the throttles and we proceeded to a successful visual approach and landing. I believe that the rate of closure with the rising terrain -- though not in our actual flight path -- generated the Ground Proximity Warning System warning.

PVT pilot flight test in which I was acting as examiner. first takeoff was a planned and briefed soft field takeoff on runway 23 at placerville. soft field takeoff was initiated at hold line with a rolling takeoff. power checked satisfactory; plus oil temperature and pressure checked; full back elevator and on CENTERLINE. as the elevators became effective and nose wheel came airborne; the pilot applicant began drifting to left of CENTERLINE. as nose raised further; now blocking forward runway visibility; the left drift slowed as though the applicant recognized the problem and was initiating a correction. I was going to take control at this point; but it appeared that applicant had control. the left wheel (both mains still on ground) came off the runway and at this point I initiated corrective action; continuing the takeoff and returning to CENTERLINE. returned control to applicant at crosswind. if the examiner has to take control of the aircraft during a check flight this is a failure of that check ride. at this point neither of us had any indication of a light strike. both of us thought it only a runway excursion and as such agreed to continue the CHKRIDE in order to complete as many tasks before a retest. total flight time was 1 1/2 hours. it was only later that day we found out about the dented right wing and broken runway light. I believe this happened because I delayed taking control of aircraft sooner. corrective action is being done and future applicants will be briefed as to my taking control for safe flight. callback conversation revealed the following: confirmed applicant was student pilot getting checked for private license. also ascertained damage was discovered by next pilot to fly aircraft during PREFLT. damage was tear in fabric under wing and as crew had felt no contact with runway light did not post flight check under wing. examiner said a&P at field said it would be classed as incident and Federal Aviation Administration not involved.

CLRED for Instrument Landing System approach; given a heading to intercept Instrument Landing System 23L at RDU. Navigational Aid was IDENTED (Instrument Landing System and Nondirectional Radio Beacon) on both #1 and #2 receivers; along with Nondirectional Radio Beacon. #3 receiver was tuned to RDU VFR Omni-Directional Radio Range; IDENTED and the Distance Measuring Equipment was held from the #2 for distance reference from VFR Omni-Directional Radio Range. just prior to outer marker we were handed off to tower. I questioned either approach or tower when I noted some fluctuations of the needle left and right which seemed strange with light winds (3 dots to full scale). as we chased the needle around it seemed like it may be returning to normal when at about 1000' Mean Sea Level it went full left and right. at that time I commanded my Fahrenheit/O to go around and at that moment we got ground contact and parts of the airport environment in sight. we continued to a normal landing. the problem was we were about halfway between the parallel runways; maybe as much as 1/8 of a mile to the right of the CENTERLINE of runway 23L. it seems that the only thing we could have done was to execute a missed at the first sign of problems; although this happens fairly often as you are just intercepting the Instrument Landing System and may cause false or unnecessary go around'S.

I turned slightly more to the right and then attempted to parallel the runway in order to keep the departing MLG Y in sight. this was difficult due to weather conditions. we told lax tower we were going around and they told us to turn to 030 degree. this would have initially placed both aircraft in the same airspace. I told my Fahrenheit/O to ask where the departing aircraft was before we would turn. lax tower would not respond. as we were so close to the radar XMITTER site I do not believe they knew. we did establish some sort of trust in the tower controller and followed their instruction for another normal approach and landing. again; however; found the ceiling on final approach to be much lower than RPTED. question: why was I cleared to land with another aircraft on the runway? he was still in the t/D zone when we pulled up along side. why no update on the lax weather. even 30 minutes after our second approach and landing. SHOULDN't the tower controller tell me he DIDN't know where we were in relation to the departing aircraft after we both entered the clouds. supplemental information from ACN 101313: the aircraft on the ground was within the t/D zone markings as we approached the runway threshold. at no time during the approach did the tower warn us of his presence. it was not apparent to the tower that there was a conflict. it was apparent to us that a conflict existed. the Captain kept the aircraft on the ground insight as he called for missed approach. the tower directed us to turn left to 030 degree; which would have put us on a possible collision course. the Captain turned right until clear of the climbing aircraft; then we paralleled his course. as we climbed into the approximately 400' Mean Sea Level cloud deck the other aircraft passed our altitude. we then turned left and followed Air Traffic Control instructions. conclusions: aircraft on ground may have inadvertently delayed his takeoff roll. tower was unable to visually see pending conflict and margin of error for landing and departing aircraft was 0 in our case.

I had it in my mind that I would be landing on runway 9. from my position; landing on runway 9 would be either a right downwind entry or a right OPS Base Operations Office entry and I noted this to the controller and I was once again cleared to land. when it became obvious to the controller that I was entering the downwind for runway 9; he mentioned that fact and I finally realized my error. 5 YRS ago I would not have given this incident a second thought. however; with all of the publicity about Federal Aviation Administration enforcement; any kind of incident makes me uneasy. my perception of how the Air Traffic Control system should work is for it to be a team effort between the pilots and the controllers. it scares me in that at this point in time; it appears that more of an adversarial relationship is starting to develop; instead of a team effort. this can't be good for either group or for the millions who travel by air every year. a lot has been written in aviation related magazines lately about this topic. the point of view is usually from the cockpit. I would be interested in the attitudes and perceptions of the controllers.

A new san diego noise regulation prohibits operation of a stage ii (LGT or MLG) aircraft after XB00 local. violators are subject to a fine. our scheduled departure time to lax was XA45. weather conditions in southern CA dictated flow restrictions past XB00. to avoid cancelling the flight; I contacted my dispatcher who also contacted Federal Aviation Administration central flow control in washington. the plan was; if we were unable to obtain a release by XB00; we would re-file to las and attempt to change destination en route. we added enough fuel for a san-las flight with PHX as an alternate and departed at XB00 filed san-las. en route center controllers were quite helpful with the destination change. I informed Air Traffic Control that I had plenty of holding fuel; and any position in the arrival stream was fine with me. upon arrival in lax; my dispatcher informed me that lax Air Route Traffic Control Center planned to violate us. subsequent communication between my company; Federal Aviation Administration central flow control and lax Air Route Traffic Control Center resulted in a verbal agreement not to file the violation. these thoughts and/or questions come to mind: we were unable to depart on any routing to lax; or to a lax holding fix; why? if Federal Aviation Administration central flow control had no problem with our plan; why did a lax Air Route Traffic Control Center supervisor want to file a violation? (communications problem?) I believe my crew and I did our passenger and company a service by operating our flight safely and by not violating local noise regulations; and (we firmly believe) Federal Aviation Regulation'S. the potential safety problem of rushed CHKLISTS and having to deal with this superfluous garbage to try to operate a flight could cause an accident.

AS we were taking off on runway 9L at ord; shortly before reaching V1; I noticed an air carrier MLG Y taxiing se on the 14L parallel at a high rate of speed. he was approaching runway 9L. we were going much too fast to stop; and I doubted he was going to. about that time tower said; 'MLG Y hold you position.' (I don't remember his number.) there was no response from MLG Y. the next call from tower showed a lot of anxiety when he said; 'MLG Y; stop!' MLG Y then stopped a short distance from runway 9L as we went by. the MLG Y pilot; with a catch in his voice; asked tower if he was told to hold short. I and my crew are in disagreement as to the tower'S response. because of the stress of the moment; we all seem to have heard something else. we don't know if the tower said; 'yes; and we expect you to respond;' or if tower said; 'no; but we expect you to respond when we call you.' we were too busy at the time to pay a lot of attention. I did go into my rotation when I saw MLG Y and got in the air; and would have cleared him; but it would have been extremely close.

I am a new Captain on the aircraft with less than 100 hours as Captain. flight planning at MHT with weather at ord below my minimums; I conferred with dispatch and we mutually agreed to add fuel and be able to hold as longitude as possible in the ord area pending weather improvement. arriving in ord area weather was still below my minimums of 300-1. held at story intersection for over 1 hour as weather at ord was on improving trend. conferred with dispatch and changed alternate to GRR; deleting MSP and DTW in order to extend hold capability. weather finally improved with Runway Visual Range of 5000' and we were pulled from holding to begin vectoring for approach. as we were intercepting Instrument Landing System to 14L; about 10 mile from outer marker; approach control stated Runway Visual Range was now 2800'. we informed approach we needed 4500' or 1 mile to begin approach. controller'S response was to stay on approach and to inform tower of intentions. it was at this time that I realized that because of the time I had spent in the holding that the possibility existed that my minimums might convert to Celsius-I as the extra flight time might put me over 100 hours. the last weather for my alternate; GRR; was deteriorating where weather at ord was improving. if we now abandoned the approach and diverted to GRR; there was the distinct possibility that the weather at GRR would be worse than at ord; and fuel considerations were becoming important. not having the time to RECHK the weather at GRR and to accurately add my time; I decided to REBRIEF the approach to 14L for Celsius-I minimums as the last RPTED Runway Visual Range was 2800'. we set our bugs to 852'; or 200' above field elevation. at 900' the runway approach lights were visible and at 852' the decision bar and runway threshold were visible with aircraft perfectly aligned with runway. at 50' below Minimum Descent Altitude I disconnected the Auto-Pilot and landed. a normal 40 degree flap landing was made with a normal stop and we exited runway 14L at the high speed about midway down runway. we informed tower we were clear and taxied to gate. it was not until later when I added my time that it showed I had 98:55; not the 100 hours required to observe Celsius-I minimums. under all variables that affected this flight I feel that the decision to continue approach to Celsius-I minimums was the safest.

WHILE on the ground at day S I received my instrument clearance from day departure via radio/land line communications. I read the clearance back and was told READBACK correct. the controller then proceeded to talk to someone else. there were no departure restrictions in the clearance. approximately 1 minute later I departed. another minute later I contacted day departure and the controller asked 'who released you?' from this question I assume the controller was not expecting me to depart but was expecting me to hold for release. paragraph 323 of the Aeronautical Information Manual states that a controller may assign departure restrictions when necessary. in this instance no departure restrictions were given. paragraph 270 of the Aeronautical Information Manual states; 'when Air Traffic Control issues a clearance or instruction pilots are expected to execute its provisions upon receipt.' I had my clearance with no departure restrictions so I executed my clearance and departed. at this point I don't feel that I have done anything in violation of the Federal Aviation Regulation'S or Aeronautical Information Manual. however; there was a pilot/controller communication problem. I feel that the Aeronautical Information Manual should be amended to require a radar release; active/void time; release time; or the statement 'contact departure on (frequency) when airborne' when departing an uncontrolled field on an instrument flight plan. this should help enforce pilot/controller XCHKING during communications. from now on I will always check first.

WHILE descending through 3500 feet on V334 approximately 10 Nautical Mile NE of the san jose VFR Omni-Directional Radio Range I suddenly saw a light twin aircraft; light blue and white in color; probably a beech dutchess; crossing in my 10-11 O'clock position; at my altitude left to right and at a distance of about 1000 feet. I made an immediate descending sharp left turn as an evasive maneuver. I passed behind and under the twin at a minimum distance of about 300 feet. I was in radar flight following and had been advised of traffic at 12 O'clock 4500 feet; 1 mile; same direction moments prior to this. after RPTING the near miss; I was told by the controller that he saw no traffic at my altitude. I assured him that there indeed was traffic. facts/opinions: had I not made the immediate maneuver I am convinced we would have collided. I am very committed to continuous scanning for traffic and was distracted by the advisory I was given and so failed to look left at that time in particular. I would guess the twin was 'sneaking through' the class Celsius and maybe nearby class B airspace by not activating his transponder. only other explanation is controller missed return or there is a radar blind spot in this area and altitude unless twin was replying with altitude 1000 feet in error.

I am a newly rated Captain at my commuter airline. prior to being rated as a Captain I had never before flown the SA227 METROLINER; however; I do not believe this had significant effect on the outcome of the incident. at the time of the incident; I was occupying the left cockpit seat of the aircraft while undergoing Initial Operating Experience with a training Captain in the right seat. we were completing the last of 4 legs of our trip. we landed on runway 32 at imperial; CA; and exited the runway to the E taxiway normally. once established on the taxiway we noticed that our single nose gear mounted taxi light was inoperative. although the environment was extremely dark; visibility along the taxiway was adequate using the existing blue edge lights. however; the taxiway lights did not extend all the way to the entrance to the airline terminal ramp; and it was difficult to see that entrance; especially without adequate aircraft lighting. compounding the problem was the glare from the lights at the terminal which effectively washed out any adequate definition of the ground surface. upon approaching the terminal ramp I said to the training Captain; 'should I turn in here?' he responded with what I understood to be an affirmative so I began my left turn. 2-3 seconds later I felt what I thought was the left main gear moving through something soft. we had entered the dirt with the left main gear about 2 feet out from the edge of the pavement. after traveling about 20 feet in this manner; in a straight line; the aircraft returned to the pavement. later inspection of the area also revealed the left propeller had struck a lightweight plastic reflective marker; about 1 feet in height; embedded in the dirt near the pavement. the marker could not be seen because there was no light to illuminate it; nor were there any cockpit indications at the moment the propeller struck the marker to indicate this had taken place. company maintenance subsequently inspected the aircraft; including the propeller; did engine runs and found no damage of any kind. imperial county airport AUTHS were notified and no action was taken against me or my company. I believe I relied too much on the training Captain'S ability to correct my mistakes and not enough on my own judgement. although not recommended for use on the ground; had I turned on the landing lights momentarily this may not have occurred.

I contacted salt lake departure; and a few seconds later; while 'mentally' flowing through the climb checklist; the Pilot Flying suddenly initiated a moderate turn to the right and stated; 'he'S coming right at us.' simultaneously; the radar controller called our traffic at ? position and 9000 feet. at this time; I did not see the traffic nor did I have time to respond to the controller; but firmly commanded the Pilot Flying 'to return to a 280 degree heading and to watch the climb rate!' the Pilot Flying was apparently distracted by the traffic approaching from his 1 O'clock position and perceived it as a traffic conflict. I now saw the bright lights of the aircraft; hesitated briefly; and decided it was not a traffic conflict. the Pilot Flying had now turned to an approximately heading of 300 degree; when he started responding to my commands to turn back to the assigned heading. now; as the assigned altitude of 8000 feet Mean Sea Level was being reached; I emphatically called out 'altitude; altitude.' at approximately 8100 feet Mean Sea Level; with palms of both hands; I briskly forced the control yoke forward arresting the climb near an altitude of 8300 feet Mean Sea Level. the controller now entered the scenario requesting our heading and altitude. I quickly explained that the Pilot Flying had 'perceived' a traffic conflict situation and had maneuvered the aircraft. the controller replied; 'that traffic was at 9000 feet Mean Sea Level and your altitude may have been 8500 feet Mean Sea Level; you may hear about this.' the entire incident lasted approximately 10 seconds.

ON jan/wed/96 an air carrier F100 aircraft was flying a flight between xxx-ZZZ; then a flight between ZZZ-YYY. I; a ZZZ based mechanic was assigned the duty to park and service the aircraft. when the aircraft approached the gate I noticed it leaning heavily on the left wing. upon docking the aircraft I found that the left outboard main tire was flat. I brought that to the Flight Crew'S attention and they informed me it felt like they had a low tire. I contacted my lead mechanic and a fellow mechanic for assistance. my lead said to change both main tires. in doing this we found the left outboard main was blown and that the left outboard brake was seized up (apparently from deicing fluid attacking the carbon brakes). we changed the left outboard brake in accordance with F100 maintenance manual 32-42 and changed both left main wheel assemblies in accordance with a work card that came with the tires out of stock. when our work was complete our lead mechanic who assisted us on the job signed off the logbook and the aircraft was released for service. around XA30 (local) the F100 took off for YYY. upon takeoff the left outboard main wheel assembly and left outboard brake assembly fell off the aircraft as 1 piece. the aircraft returned to field and landed without incident. I do not understand why this happened but I do know we followed paperwork. supplemental information from ACN 324741: wheel was installed and torqued in accordance with maintenance manual and at no time was there any evidence of there being anything abnormal about the installation. supplemental information from ACN 324743: on arrival at ZZZ; we had experienced a flat tire on the left outboard main wheel. maintenance then changed both left main wheels as well as a defective outer left brake assembly. following our subsequent outbound takeoff; the tower RPTED that we appeared to lose at least 1 main wheel. a low-level fly-by confirmed that the outer left main wheel was missing. we then declared an emergency and entered holding in the local area to burn off fuel. after that we made an uneventful approach and landing on runway 28L at ZZZ. passenger and crew deplaned on the taxiway. suspected cause: improper installation. the maintenance department is currently conducting an investigation.

BEFORE the flight from YYC to ord the ground service crew towed aircraft to the gate from its overnight pad. the aircraft had ice on the wings so we informed the crew we would need to be deiced. the weather was clear with a temperature of 3 degree Celsius. we started the ENGS at the gate and applied engine anti-ice. we then prepared the aircraft for deicing which appeared to take place normally. after deicing we taxied to runway 34 with no delays and were cleared for an immediate takeoff. it was my takeoff and we were making a maximum power takeoff. I advanced power to 1.4 EPR and called AUTOTHROTTLES; which the Captain activated. acceleration was normal until about 80 Knots when I noticed a muffled noise and the aircraft yawed slightly right. I glanced once more at the AIRSPD and saw 90 Knots and then focused my attention back outside. the aircraft yawed right once more and the Captain initiated the abort between 90-100 Knots. we returned to the gate and left the flaps extended so an inspection could be made to insure there was no damage to the flaps. upon inspection of the right engine; a number of fan blades were bent out of shape. contract maintenance informed us that the fan would have to be changed if not the whole engine. upon inspecting the wings no damage was found; but there was ice on the wings just aft of the heater blankets and on the leading edges of the flaps. supplemental information from ACN 324727: aircraft commenced takeoff roll on runway 34 using maximum power due to having been deiced at gate. at approximately 80-90 Knots I noticed the right EPR fluctuate and felt aircraft pull slightly to right. I initiated an abort without incident and cleared runway. after arrival at gate I and the First Officer along with maintenance; observed several bent blades on the foremost compressor blade. we also observed several small spots of ice on the aft part of the right wing. it is unlikely this was picked up during taxi or even during the abort as the weather conditions were clear and the runway was also basically free of contaminants. this leads me to believe that the aircraft was not properly deiced to begin with.

I understood that temperature and DEWPOINTS are used in the forecasting models as well; therefore causing inaccurate forecasts to be generated. 2) after the technician could not be contacted; the National Weather Service was supposed to call a backup technician for this priority outage. they did not do this. 3) the maintenance technician said that the reason for the outage was lack of maintenance due to the fact that one of the technicians bid to another job and his spot was not filled. 4) while the technician worked on the equipment; he put it back on line and allowed it to disseminate inaccurate data -- that puts us back at item #1.

2 aircraft climbing NBOUND. aircraft #1 climbing to FL350. aircraft #2 climbing to FL280. aircraft #2 out-climbed aircraft #1 and vertical separation was lost. aircraft #2 should have been laddered up underneath aircraft #1 instead of climbing both to altitude and thinking #1 will out climb #2. supplemental information from ACN 356730: air carrier B747 and air carrier B737 both departed SFO and were in en route climb phase. right side recognized that horizontal and lateral separation was diminishing; but had vertical. he saw that vertical was 1100 feet and increasing and elected to let it alone. when rate of climb on top aircraft began to decrease; and vertical separation was decreasing; he was unable to take other action to ensure any other type of separation. he bet on rate of climb and did not ensure anything else.

WHILE boarding; the #1 flight attendant advised me that we had a drunk passenger in row x. in a very short time the #2 flight attendant advised me that he was a problem and that she wanted him off the plane. I called the ramp tower and asked for police and the proper people. he left the airplane peacefully and I don't know what happened after that. the agent working the flight was very helpful. all in all; this was no big deal except for 1 major problem. I later found out that the guy was so drunk that he had to be helped on the airplane by the passenger assistance people. I don't mean our agents -- who of course would know better -- but the people that push the wheelchairs and drive the carts. someone needs to counsel these people that while their job may be to assist passenger; it is not to assist drunk passenger on the airplanes. I feel that if a guy is too drunk to walk on the airplane; then he is too drunk to ride for 2 1/2 hours on the same full airplane.

I continued the flight; however; because my student was capable of handling the aircraft in these conditions and it was excellent experience for him. after approximately 4 touch and goes on runway 11; my student told me on the upwind that he thought we had not been cleared to land. he was right; we had not been cleared to land; or for the option; for that touch and go.

I was cleared for a visual approach to runway 15 ASE. however; wind favored runway 33. the aircraft landing before me was asked to remain E of CTRLINE runway 15/33. I was told to follow that aircraft. I entered a circle approach to runway 33 (I was single pilot). I was concerned about an aircraft that was overflying airport (C172). my performance/judgement was more concerned looking outside and not in checking which runway was the active. in fact; the tower asked me 2 times (twice) my intentions. I stated I was landing runway 15; when in fact the runway I was circling to was runway 33. had I looked at the approach plate; or even the airport diagram; I would have known I was going the wrong way. it was not until I started a circle OPS Base Operations Office that I discovered my error. I just entered left downwind and landed. this was an event that caused me problems; but it shows a lack of judgement and overconfidence when landing at the same airport many times.

HOW problem arose: I fly piper NAVAJOS. one aircraft was RPTED by another pilot to have an erratic attitude indicator. since this pilot also said the aircraft'S heater WASN't operating well; the conclusion was that the attitude indicator problem was cold related. we decided to extensively preheat the cabin; see if the attitude indicator functioned; and take the plane to FAI. on inspecting the cabin after this other pilot'S problems; I noted the heater temperature control was turned down. I checked weather for the flight to FAI; which showed Visual Flight Rules for departure from barrow; Instrument Flight Rules conditions over the brooks range en route; and Visual Flight Rules in FAI. Pilot Reports were not available; but the briefer said to expect to be between layers en route. I filed an Instrument Flight Rules flight plan along V444 from barrow (BRW) to bettles (BTT) to fairbanks (FAI). meanwhile; a ground heating unit was applied to the aircraft. after start; I noted the attitude indicator functioning perfectly and the heater putting out lots of heat. I activated my Instrument Flight Rules flight plan and departed BRW at XA30. about 20 minutes into the flight; I contacted FAI operations via radio telephone relay and informed my manager that the plane was functioning perfectly (attitude indicator and heater). I was told to return to barrow. I canceled my Instrument Flight Rules flight plan and did a 180 degree turn. 10 minutes later; operations called and told me to continue to FAI. since I'D been told that zan ISN't very tolerant of Instrument Flight Rules 'pop-up' clearance requests in the arctic coast area; and since I could see Visual Meteorological Conditions above the clouds Federal Aviation Regulation in front of me towards FAI (from 11500 feet Mean Sea Level); I elected to remain Visual Flight Rules and follow my Global Positioning System direct to FAI and pick up an Instrument Flight Rules descent. as I approached the brooks range; the cloud tops got higher. I climbed to 13500 feet Mean Sea Level planning to contact Flight Service Station and refile along V444; which was now to my right. ARAKTRUK pass RPTED 3/4 mile visibility and bettles was Visual Flight Rules; so I headed direct toward bettles and started trying to contact Flight Service Station. at about this time; my crew hatch; located directly to my left; blew open. since I was single pilot; I set the Auto-Pilot and started working to close the door. I felt it critical to secure this door -- with outside air temperature approximately 25 degree below zero; I was worried about losing the attitude indicator with night approaching. after several minutes of struggling; I got the door closed. it was then that I noticed the aircraft'S altitude had changed and showed a descent through 4500 feet. I immediately applied climb power and XCHKED my position which showed me S of the highest peaks; and leveled off at 7500 feet; which is safe in that area. I started feeling strange. subsequently; I discovered that I was at 17500 feet and had apparently misread my altimeter. when I thought I was descending through 4500 feet I was actually at 14500 feet. I am convinced HYPOXIA and the cold; coupled with my relative inexperience operating single pilot made dealing with the crew hatch problem even worse. fortunately; I was able to immediately descend; get the Auto-Pilot set up and get back on an Instrument Flight Rules flight plan. the rest of the flight was uneventful. contributing factors: while discussing the crew hatch problem with maintenance; I was told the problem was longitude-standing. I have had the door pop after takeoff before and was always able to close it quickly with copilot'S help. I have never had one open in cruise before. the confusion with operations regarding returning to barrow was a factor; causing me to cancel Instrument Flight Rules flight plan which would have kept me at 11000 feet the whole way. my disinclination to contact zan to re-establish an Instrument Flight Rules flight plan was based on rumor. I will call and file as the situation dictates from now on. lastly; after a rash of cold weather related problems in barrow; I was anxious to fulfill the company'S expectations. phone discussions with the company'S general manager and president that day made it clear the plane had to get to FAI. although the flight marked the beginning of an 11 day vacation; I honestly don't think 'personal get THEREITIS' was a factor; as evidenced by my desire to take a functional plane 180 degree back to barrow. I think 'professional get THEREITIS' was a factor. corrective actions: the door; heater and attitude indicator are being thoroughly checked by maintenance. I have instructed other pilots not to try this flight Visual Flight Rules unless there are no adverse conditions en route. I have a much humbler attitude about what I can tackle single pilot than I did 24 hours ago. upon returning from vacation; I have an Instrument Flight Rules proficiency check scheduled and have asked my check airman for additional training. also; I've learned to put a bit less faith I the 'altitude hold' feature of Auto-Pilot.

AS I am a recent pilot (I received my private pilot certificate on FEB/XA/01); I make it a point to train regularly on my aircraft (a lake amphibian renegade 250). on jun/XA/01; I gave myself some WATERWORK; steep turns; rough and glassy water LNDGS; as well as air work; slow turns; steep turns; stalls. after this work; I proceeded to SHECHRADER airport for refueling. this is a class E UNCTLED airport. I proceeded to enter the pattern downwind and CLRLY announced my intentions. 2 aircraft were in proximity. one had just taken off and another was back-taxiing runway 14. I proceeded to go through my checklist on downwind. when I arrived abeam the numbers; I interrupted my checklist to determine if I should extend my downwind for the back-taxiing act. I then continued my checklist inadvertently skipping over the landing gear section. I landed with the gear up. minimal damage was sustained by the aircraft and the runway was cleared 1 hour later after the airplane'S landing gear was extended using jacks. I should have visually checked the gear twice as I was instructed this would have alleviated the incident.

OUR flight was from buenos AIRES to ZZZ; us; and our contract maintenance was having a problem getting the forward cargo door open. it was on deferral and needed to be manually opened but could be electrically closed. the contract maintenance folks were not familiar with the door and seemed to be having trouble; so I called our maintenance folks to insure proper procedures were being followed; and after a 30 minute delay we got the cargo loaded and were on our way. my confidence in the contract maintenance was not very high at this point. approximately 1 hour out of buenos AIRES; NBOUND on UA301; #1 hydraulic fluid level went to zero. we got out the manuals and followed the procedures and called our maintenance control ZZZ along with our dispatcher. after reviewing all the required pubs and discussing all the options available; a joint plan was formulated. in light of the quality of the contract maintenance in EZE and the fact that our remaining hydraulic system and their back-up system were all functioning normally; it was decided to press on to our destination. we had several divert airfields along our route of flight and were prepared to divert if the need presented itself. we kept an eye on the fuel burn and the weather for each divert field all the way to destination where an uneventful landing was made. after thinking about it for a few days; I think the more prudent course of action would have been to return to EZE and taken our chances with contract maintenance plus all the wasted fuel; broken passenger connections and delays a return would have caused. sometimes the pace of operations plus economic considerations can steer your thinking from the most safety conscious choice to another which is balanced between safety and operational necessity.

WE were 6 miles behind an a-300 on the Instrument Landing System to 27R calm wind. I asked the First Officer to fly up to a Department Of Transportation high to avoid wake turbulence. at 3 miles from touchdown the tower informed us that controller was going to clear a 747 to takeoff before we landed. at 2 miles the controller told us to continue the approach and be ready for a go around. I mentioned that he had already cleared us to land. he responded by saying continue. he cleared us to land at 150 feet and the 747 had not yet left the ground. I considered a go around; but rejected the idea because of the collision potential with the 747 taking off. the 747 broke ground 5 secs; as counted by another flight watching from midfield on the parallel taxiway. there was considerable jet blast turbulence in the flare. I called the tower supervisor and asked why the need to cut it so close. his response centered around 'that'S the way we have to do business and the controller had the legal separation.' I disagree; controling in a way that prevents the landing aircraft from going around is not the way we should be doing business; not to mention what would have happened if the 747 had aborted. mia was not busy at the time thus I can find no good reason for this to have happened. please FWD to the mia tower for training purposes. callback conversation with RPTR revealed the following information: during callback the RPTR'S concern centered around the fact that the tower controller was in the mode of compressing traffic as much as possible when the relatively low activity level at the airport did not seem to require it. the attitude of the supervisor that he talked to after the fact appeared to be that it was legal and separation was not compromised since the departing aircraft was in the air before the RPTR'S touch down. the RPTR conferred with the observing crew after the fact and they said that it was such an interesting scenario that they took it upon themselves to note the time between the B747'S lift off and the RPTR'S touch down. they RPTED 5 secs as the elapsed time. the RPTR also said that the flying pilot was required to use up to full control deflection during the flare because of turbulence created by the B747 engine blast in the touch down zone. the estimated separation between the aircraft was 5000 to 6000 feet since the approach was made slightly above the glide slope and the touch down was longer than normal and the departing aircraft appeared to be lifting off in the last 2000 feet of the runway. the RPTR said that as he has reanalyzed the situation he would probably have elected to go around.

THE simulated emergency landing was made with the aircraft PWRPLANT shut down and the propeller stopped. the motivation for this emergency practice was to demonstrate to the student pilot that the aircraft can glide to earth safely with the engine failed. the simulation required an airport with no traffic. on this day at saint charles county airport; severe thunderstorms had moved through the area; causing most of the flying activity to cease. at 1600 feet; the weather at the airport changed to good Visual Meteorological Conditions. the training session was focused upon traffic pattern operations with multiple takeoffs and LNDGS. the area around the airport was clear of traffic and there were no aircraft operating on the surface. the simulated landing was executed as planned and the outcome was as planned. that is; the student is more confident that the aircraft can be safely maneuvered to a safe landing when the engine is not operational. during the approach to land; a 180 degree turn from downwind to final was required. during this turn; the area behind could not be viewed; which could introduce a problem with this operation. if another aircraft arrived to land on the opposite end of planned runway there would be no opportunity to go around with the engine off. in this case; no other aircraft presented a danger; but it is possible that an aircraft could arrive out of view and unannounced. the benefit of this type of operation would be eliminated if an accident occurred. the student was briefed on the justification of the operation; at a select location and altitude with no other aircraft in sight. there is the possibility that the student pilot would attempt this operation independently to emulate the actions of the flight instructor. it is important to stress the purpose of the exercise to address this concern. in conclusion; although there is a benefit to this operation; the potential for an accident during or perpetuated by; is reason enough to only simulate the emergency landing with the engine at idle power setting. callback conversation with RPTR revealed the following information: RPTR stated that he has reevaluated the benefits versus the risk in conducting engine and propeller stopped simulated forced LNDGS mainly due to the unexpected traffic at an UNCTLED airport environment that could not be avoided if needed. RPTR is aware that the instructor is ultimately responsible for the successful and safe outcome of pilot training.
